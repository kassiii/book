THE MASCULINE WAY – BREAKUPS EDITED 

The masculine way: handling breakups
 
INTRODUCTION
 
This book is going to be structured differently than a conventional book. Think of this book as a conversation at a bar with someone.
 
I do a lot of coaching with guys, and many ask the same questions, but they will try to phrase it differently, hoping for a particular outcome or answer from me.
 
I will often bring up how I was having a conversation with clients. I use these conversations to drive a point home.
 
Many people who will read this book have been watching my YouTube channel or other coaches’ channels, so you may hear some repetitive information here, but I want it to be as straightforward and transparent as possible about what you need to be focused on and doing.
 
Getting clarity is the most crucial goal following a breakup. Emotions cause the exact opposite to happen. 
 
They cause confusion. Right now, you are in your most emotional state, and it’s almost impossible to think clearly. You can't act correctly if you can't think clearly. 
 
I want to help put you in the best possible spot for success. Sometimes that’s getting an ex back, and sometimes it’s not. 
 
 
Who the hell am I? 
If you came across me on YouTube, you know who I am. 
 
However, some people may only buy this book after seeing my channel, so I invite you to check out the YouTube channel. It’s called masculine energy.
 
I’ve been coaching men through their breakups for several years now. I went through it all just like you are now. I will tell my story, and what I will do is let you know where you can skip ahead if you don’t want to hear it. 
Over the years, I have seen it all. 
 
There are so many different breakup stories. Some of them are simple, and some are complicated. My job is to get you from a cloudy state into a clear one. 
 
That’s what I promise my students. 
 
For years, I coached people permanently, meaning they would buy into my coaching programme, and I would help them get from cloudy to clear. 
 
I watched thousands of people go through the process. I will reveal what the successful people and the unsuccessful people did. 
 
This book is going to be, from my perspective, about coaching men over the phone and through email. Please accept my apologies in advance if some of this seems disjointed. 
 
Okay, enough intro. Let’s go
 
My story. 
 
So, as I said earlier, you can skip this part if you want to. I didn’t care much for other people’s stories when I was learning this. 
 
However, some people were interested in how I handled all my breakups, and if you apply what I did, you can achieve some success. 
 
Now, success entirely depends on what you want. Most people think they want their ex back in the beginning because they are so hurt, but
 
In truth, rejection breeds intense obsession. We want the person who rejected us. 
 
That’s what happened to me. I started young. I was 15 years old when I had my first "serious" relationship. 
 
Adults always laugh, but anyone who has been in a relationship and fell in love when they were young knows how serious it felt to them.
 
It was just like the movies said it was (more on this later). It was pure bliss. I couldn’t think of anyone but her. For the sake of this story, let’s call her Summer.
 
Summer was a cute girl; however, she did have some problems, which I ignored. I honestly didn’t know any better. 
 
This girl was about six months younger than me at the time. So, we were both immature. 
 
I was an athlete. She used to get insanely jealous when I would do anything else with my friends. 
 
She would start fights and get angry at me for hanging out with my friends. She automatically thought I would cheat on her and hurt her somehow. 
 
There were girls around, but she had trust issues. I’m not the guy to cheat, but her constant distrust drove a wedge between us. 
 
So, I played on the school teams, and I played soccer and football with my friends all the time. 
 
Now, all this doesn’t mean we didn’t have good times. I’m sparing you the good times because you don’t need to know about them. 
 
As time went on, our fights got worse and worse. Fighting constantly is how you know things are going to end eventually. 
 
Too much negativity will cause breakups (more on this later).
 
Two years into our relationship, she decided it was time to leave. Now I want to make a point here. 
 
I was completely aware that we shouldn’t be together anymore, but I was willing to continue to try to fix things. 
 
Men will deal with a lot more shit before they leave (generally speaking). 
 
I started begging and pleading over and over. When I think back to it now, it makes me cringe and laugh simultaneously. 
 
It was the hardest thing I went through up until then, and I was trying everything to get over it. I lost all kinds of weight; I was skipping class. I was isolating myself.
 
My friends tried to get me to come out with them, but all I could talk about was summer. They got tired of hearing about it. They wanted the best for me but were sick of hearing about my shit. 
 
People get tired of hearing about negativity eventually. If you notice your friends gradually drifting away from you, you’re likely turning them off to your presence. 
 
About three months went by, and she came back around. We hung out a few times, but she was cold toward me. I invited myself over. I was close to her family. I was close with her father. 
 
I’m sure I don’t have to tell you, but the family makes the breakup harder. 
 
She finally came around when I stopped chasing her around. I was referred to as "a lost puppy dog" by her friends and some other family members. 
 
Word quickly got around that I was acting weak, prompting me to walk away. We had a lot of the same friends, so it made me feel even worse that they knew I was acting like a bitch.
 
I started hitting the school gym daily and pouring myself into working out.
 
I got sage advice from a high school teacher of mine. He was my English teacher at the time.
 
He said, "You walk away and completely forget she exists; she will come back crawling on all fours."
 
I didn’t believe him then because TV shows and movies brainwashed me.
I decided it was time to let go and walk away. When I did this summer started to think twice about losing me.
 
Summer was partying her ass off as well. All those horrible thoughts went through my head, like, "Is she sleeping with other people? Or is she seeing some other guy?"
 
In my case, I found out she was sleeping with other people while we were apart. I was suffering at home, and she was out doing her thing. She has every right to do so, but it’s not something I forgot. Neither should you. 
 
A couple months later, she came back around, and I was stunned. I went to my English teacher again and asked his advice. He said, "Do you think the issues between you have been fixed?" I said no; I don’t think so. He said, "I highly doubt things will change between you."
 
It was hard to take this advice, and to be honest, I didn’t listen to him at first. After some initial reluctance, I ended up taking Summer back. 
 
At first, things were okay. We started up again. We saw each other almost every day. About two months go by, and we start fighting again. I couldn’t get over the pain she caused and how much of a fool I looked when I was going through the breakup. 
 
That’s the stuff that stays when she comes back. You will remember how you felt and what other people saw you do when you were hurt. 
 
I stayed with her for a year and a half after that. We were together for a total of 4 years. She broke up with me again, but I wasn’t hurt as much this time. 
 
She said she wanted to leave because "we aren’t compatible," which was true, but women always give shitty excuses when they leave men (more on that later).
 
She immediately started seeing other guys, and I started learning more about women. 
 
It took me about 4–5 months to start dating again and think more clearly. During this healing phase, I slept around quite a lot. 
 
(Sleeping around will bring you absolutely no joy post breakup. I have spoken to thousands of guys online who have done this. I've also done this myself. It won't make you feel better. You feel good for a brief moment in time, but it's just a distraction from the real work you need to do. So, if you're considering doing so, just don't. (Take my advice on this one.) 
 
I was still in good shape and confident enough to be attractive to women. I've never had trouble attracting women. It was keeping them long-term. I struggled to maintain attraction with women over time. I got boring in most of my relationships.
 
After sleeping around and having "fun," I started going out with another girl. Let’s call her Jane. 
 
This girl was one of the prettiest girls I had ever seen then, and I just went for it. 
 
We had a couple of classes together, and she lived about a two-minute walk from my place, so it was easy for us to see each other. 
 
We hit it off right away. Things were good for about a year or so, and then on Valentine’s Day, she decided she wanted to leave. I was blindsided, and again, I begged and pleaded. I needed a few smacks on the head before I realised what I was doing was wrong. 
 
to paint this picture clearly for you. I was outside her bedroom, and I was begging out loud for her. Yes, outside, where people can see and hear you. It was 11 at night, too, so people were hearing this shit. 
 
It was bad. I was bad. I want you to see this because of how far you can come. I was THE BETA. THE SIMP. I was scared shitless because I didn’t want to get hurt again, so I was extra nice. 
 
Anyway, when she left, she came back about three days later. She said she had made a mistake. This time I jumped into no-contact mode right away. I took my English teacher’s advice again and put it into my brain that I was sticking to it. Back then, there was nobody to listen to for advice about women. Youtube was popular but didn't have any channels with good advice yet.
 
This time, I was a lot stronger. You don't realise how strong you are until you have no choice but to be Strong. (Something I learned from David Goggins.) I suggest you check out his books if you don’t know who he is. 
 
This dude is one of my favourites, along with Cameron Hanes. These two are about pushing to the next limit, achieving goals, and being as strong as you can be.
 
I waited about a week until I decided I wanted to reach out to her. I spoke to her a bit between then and now, but it was mostly about plans we had made together.
 
Just so you're aware.
 
All your plans go out the window when you go through a breakup. Let’s say it’s a trip to Mexico. Everything has been planned, and then you guys break up. Don’t bother going on the trip, thinking it's going to mend things between you. It's not. It doesn’t work that way, and in all my years of coaching this, I still haven’t seen it work or heard of it working. 
 
Apply this to whatever situation arises. When someone decides to leave you, they are literally imagining their life without you and believing that it will be better without you. 
 
They’ve been thinking about it for a long time. longer than you believe. Little dopamine fixes don’t change a relationship's dynamic. It doesn’t raise attraction levels, and it doesn’t make them think you’re awesome and fun to have around permanently. 
 
Like I said before, a breakup happens because of continuous negative energy. If it's fighting, then it's fighting. If it’s a man acting weak or needy, then it’s that. Sometimes it’s both. Sometimes it's ten things. The exception to this rule is if abuse comes into play.
 
I eventually went back out with her. Something was very off, though. Inside, I felt like I had made a bad decision. I was listening to Drake's song "Doing It Wrong" repeatedly. It’s funny how music can help you and talk to you. She was acting much more feminine toward me. She was nicer. Closer. That’s the best way I can describe it. 
 
She was texting me more. She was putting herself in my orbit so I could come see her. Now remember, we live very close together, so it was easy to do. 
 
It was during this time that I found two guys online. Doc Love and Coach Corey Wayne
These two guys really reinforced everything I needed to learn about relationships and women. Corey Wayne in particular. Most of the people reading this book will know who he is, but in case you don't, just look him up on YouTube and buy his books.
 
They are very good, and he is 99 percent right from what I’ve seen. 
 
That feeling was still there. That strange sensation. I was wondering what it could have been. I started asking my female friends about it. At the time, I had a lot of female friends. 
 
Most of them told me the feeling would pass and I should just try to be happy. One person told me it wasn’t normal. I should have listened to her. More time went by, and I started liking other women in our group of friends. I was talking to her more than I was to Jane.
 
Life has a funny way of moving people in and out of your life. If you listen to your gut, you will get far in life. I was distant for a while, and she sensed something was wrong, and I said I needed a break. I was partying like a rock star during this break. sleeping around and having fun. She was at home worrying about me. She was taking it well, though. She applied "no contact" to me without really knowing what it was. 
 
I ended up thinking about her a lot. I was wondering what she was doing while I was partying. Eventually I started talking to her again, and we saw each other again. Things never changed. We just weren’t good for each other. Things were okay for another year or so, and then she cheated on me with this guy in her program. 
This guy was doing a lot more than I was with his life. He was in the same program as her, and they saw each other every day. They were studying with each other after school and shit like that, and I thought nothing of it. 
 
Looking back, I was foolish, immature, and naive. I believe in people having the freedom they need in a relationship, but now I know that if a woman is "hanging out" with another guy, she is lining up her replacement.
 
Anyway, I found out she was doing me dirty, and we broke up. I bought her a promise ring and everything. I handled it well, but like the first breakup, I looked like a fool because they were fucking for months while I was there. I met this guy, shook his hand, and everything. This dude was a huge piece of sh*t, but I also should have known better. 
 
Now I do. The person to blame is her, though. I never understood why guys get mad at other guys when a woman is cheating. 
 
I was obviously mad at this guy, but she was the problem. He has no honor, but I didn’t really expect him to. No matter what, guys will try to fuck your girl.
 
Getting mad at a dude that doesn’t even know you exist is even worse. You’ve seen those videos or heard those stories where a dude beats the living shit out of a guy because he was fucking his girl. A lot of the time, guys have no idea you even exist. He’s trying to have a good time and then gets sparked by you.
 
I moved on fast. I looked back and reflected on what I learned. I was doing everything wrong. I was not acting masculine at all while I was in this relationship or the previous one. 
 
I started going through Corey Wayne’s videos and books. I was also listening to "Doc Love. 
 
It still took a while for things to stick, though. I still made big mistakes. It takes a long time to learn and detach from old behaviors. I was still blue pilled. 
 
I had a few flings, but they didn’t last long. One thing about women is that you rarely catch them single for a while. They are almost always ending a relationship or have an old ex who wants her back.
 
Sometimes she is seeing someone she doesn’t really like that much, but it is free attention, so she continues to see him.
 
I meet my next girl. I met her while playing Call of Duty. I know, lol.
 
We lived one city over from each other, which was about an hour away. We hit it off immediately. Let’s call her Tess. One of the best lessons I learned from Corey Wayne and just general life experience is that people can hide who they are for a long time. 
 
People can hide their true intentions for several months. Something did learn is people will eventually tell on themselves. 
 
At first, things were normal. About 3 months into the relationship, I saw some major red flags. This girl had some serious trust issues. She also had some issues with her parents and family. This girl was a straight up roller coaster ride for the rest of the relationship. 
 
It only lasted about 8 months or so. At the time, I was convinced that this girl had BPD (borderline personality disorder). She would start random fights and tell me she was going to break up with me for no reason at all. I was trying to make the relationship work, and she would come up with excuses for why it would not work. No matter what I did, it was never good enough. 
 
This is when things really clicked for me. I wasn’t vetting the women I’ve been choosing to go out with for long enough, and I would fall for these girls based on their looks almost right away. 
 
There was a short moment in time when things were good for about 6 weeks. She started a random fight and changed all that. 
 
This is what people with serious issues do. They sabotage things. There are many reasons why people who want to hurt others will do this. This girl had daddy issues and was abused when she was young. And that’s what I was able to find out. 
 
She was a walking red flag, and instead of just walking away, I went into "I need to fix her" mode. This is very common for guys that come through my coaching program. They jump into wanting to fix a woman. Nothing I did worked. She wouldn’t change, and things just continued. I was so stressed out. I couldn’t work properly. It was a nightmare being with this woman. I so badly wanted to make it work, and this is the problem with people. They get stuck in a certain way of thinking, and it’s just not working for them. I see my students do this all the time. They won’t give up a certain pattern of thinking until the pain is just too much. 
 
This is what happened to me. I got smacked with a bag of bricks. This girl decided to cheat on me and leave. I started no contact and started living my life again. I told her to never contact me again. Even though the relationship was short, I was still really hurt by its ending. 
 
I was having a hard time with it all. I walked through a nature trail near my house every single day. I listened to music and YouTube videos about self-growth and how to understand people.
 
I came to many conclusions that I will share in more detail later in the book, but I knew that even if Tess came back, I couldn’t take her back. I knew it was a bad idea. She added way too much stress and headache to my life. I was 23–24 at the time, and all I needed to do was work on myself. This is a strange age for men as well, because these are the years when we should be figuring things out. 
 
When I was 20, I was in college, but I hated it. I hated school. I personally don’t see a point in it unless you’re studying certain things. like STEM, for example. I started changing my life. I was seriously depressed at this point in my life and needed to change, or I would be dead. That’s how bad things were in my mind.
 
For years, I made women and relationships my focus and purpose instead of my own goals and dreams. It took a while to change my mindset. It was during my next relationship that things changed for the better for me.
 
For the sake of the book, this girl's name is Tanya. I met Tanya at work. Tanya is petite, with blue eyes and brown hair. Now, going into this relationship, I was skeptical. As you now know, I’ve been through a few relationships that ended poorly and caused a ton of pain.
 
She could tell I was distant from the start, but she was patient. just for clarity. My last relationship ended in August, and I met Tanya in September. So, I was out of the relationship for about a month. I didn’t make it official with Tanya until early October.
 
Tanya continued to be patient and kind. She knows how to communicate better than anyone I've been with before. She knew what she wanted. She’s a happy person by default. Someone who looks for the good in things in life and people.
 
I bring this up because some people in this world have a bias towards negativity. You can tell by their body language and the words they use. You’ll hear things like "things never work out for me," or they will place blame on something or someone else: "I never have the energy to workout" (more on this later). Tanya is a happy-go-lucky girl, which is the kind of girl you want. People get attached to their emotions. They truly believe they are that singular emotion. A good example is anger. Some people think they are just angry all the time instead of just thinking they are feeling angry. There is a big difference there. My next book will talk a lot more about this.
 
She is very easy to get along with. We have had our fights, but they are rare, and they don’t last long. Every time there is a disagreement, we quickly come to the conclusion that we are being stupid. Just so you know, I am always working on this stuff too. getting better and better. I came from an okay childhood. My father was a single dad for most of my childhood years. My mother wasn’t around. Without going into too much detail, I had a lot of stuff I had to work on for myself. 
 
Where I am now
 
To this day, Tanya and I are still together. We met when I was 24; I'm 32 now as I write this book. Being with someone who is easy to get along with is priceless. 
 
Now, when it comes to relationships, I've done a lot of work. I had issues communicating with myself. I had anger issues that I needed to work out. Many of the things I had to work on came from my own personal life. 
 
For example, I was never a good employee. I know many of you are going to laugh at that, and you probably would rather do anything than go to work. I get it. I was dealing with depressive thoughts all the time. It was such a grind to just go to work. 
 
I’m the type of person who will try to fix the situation. I started looking for ways to make money online. I started in 2017 and never looked back. I became financially free in 2019 and continued to grow my assets online. My third book will be all about this and self-growth, so keep an eye out for it when it comes out. 
The depression in my life came directly from the fact that I was working on other people’s goals and not my own. I stopped being relationship focused and started making more money, but I was still not happy because I needed to start my own side hustle. 
 
I don’t think everyone in the world needs to do this, but I do think that people should always have another source of income. I personally think it’s silly to depend on one source of income. Corporations don’t personally care about you. They will replace you tomorrow. 
 
As soon as I made that shift, I was much happier. Right up until this day, I have been extremely focused on my goals and dreams while already being free.
 
By the end of my 20s, I was in the best spot when it came to relationships and money. I talk to my students about this concept, which will be in Book 3, but it’s about your personal pillars.
 
The pillars are.
- Health
- Wealth
- Personal relationships
- Self-growth and development
- Social circle and friends
 
I will go into detail in Book 3, but this is an overview for anyone who might want it. There are also subtopics under all these. For example, personal relationships will have a subtopic about female nature. Some men are doing fantastic in their wealth, health, and self-growth pillars. They may even be good at attracting women but struggle to keep them. 
 
Often, it’s because they don’t understand how to remain attractive over time with women. They don’t know how to continue the mystery. They just fall into a boring relationship because they miss a key concept. Some of the men I’ve coached over the years don’t think they can even attract high quality women. They take whatever they can get. 
 
It is essential to work on these pillars in your life. To do this, you must first become aware of them. You go through a breakup because you’re doing something wrong. Whether it’s choosing the wrong woman, trying to change her, being too nice, etc. When you get dumped, you’re forced to see what went wrong and choose whether to change it or not. 
Many of my students will continue to do the wrong thing because they are afraid of what change will entail. Some people are so identified with that version of themselves that they are afraid to develop an entirely new version. 
 
This is where I am now. I have reached a high point at 32. I have built up a few businesses to a great point, and all I did was start. Right now, I am expanding and buying new businesses. When you buy your freedom back, you buy your time back, which means you have time to look up new things. You have time to try new things and see what works for you and doesn’t. 
 
My business is mostly passive. I have teams of people who work for me and do most of the tasks. When you have removed yourself from the need for money, you can explore your true purpose in life. Now, this is just my path. It doesn’t mean you have to do exactly what I did. All I’m telling you to do is look around a bit. Does your job or business excite and fulfil you? Or is it just a drag?
 
One day I decided to look around, stop blaming everyone else for my problems, and take control of my life. I started tracking where all my hours went, and I was wasting so much time. My third book will be about this, so if this speaks to you, be sure to check it out when it comes out. It will be announced on my YouTube channel.
 
Right now, I am married to Tanya and continuing to grow my businesses every day. Anyone who watches my YouTube channel knows I often talk about it. I don’t say these things to brag. I am just like you. All I did was change my habits and choices. You are one choice away from a completely different life.
 
I continue to study people and relationships and coach men daily through their problems. I strive to become the best coach I can be. I believe that making one decision and going all in on it will have the greatest impact. 
 
Many of my students lack attraction skills. I get them to focus on learning exactly how to change that, and that’s all we focus on until we’ve mastered it. I want you guys to do the same. 
 
Some of you reading this will have much more relationship experience than me and will think, "What can I learn from this guy?" I promise that if you learn the fundamentals, it doesn’t matter how much experience you have or don’t have. The fundamentals are the same, regardless of age. If you have no experience, you will still be going down the right path. 
 
What I want for my students and those who read these books is for you to learn from your mistakes and have the courage to face your fears. Face them straight on, and don’t let anyone get in your way. To me, that’s what being a man is. Facing your fears and being brave means protecting people who can’t protect themselves. teaching people who need guidance and love. showing the way to people who are lost. 
 
Men today have very little guidance. I have had messages from hundreds of young men telling me that I have helped change their lives. They now make better decisions. They sought me out at first because of a breakup, and they realized their lives were a complete mess. Coaching calls help me get down to the nitty-gritty of the problem. Our society likes to put a band-aid on things. Anyway, that’s my story so far, and things are going great for me, and if I can help you get there, I will.

Why do women leave men?
 
As a coach for several years now, I have seen it all. In many different situations with many different people coming from all races, religions, and creeds, I have found a few things to be true when it comes to people breaking up.
 
Before I go into that, I understand that the relationship did have its good times. After doing many phone calls with people over the years, they want to tell me about the good times. I know you had good times and good memories. The issue comes into play when too much negativity hits the relationship.
 
Too much negativity will lead to a loss of attraction. When that happens, they will stop believing in the relationship and start thinking of getting out. 
 
Now, this can vary depending on the people involved. Some people can handle a lot of negativity before wanting to leave. Some people can only handle a little. The point is that the person who was once with you doesn’t think the relationship is going anywhere positive anymore, and fixing it is a difficult task. I will go into that later in the book.
 
Some relationships have such strong connections, and some have weaker connections. Some people just have that spark in their relationship, but that spark isn’t always something that keeps people together. Guys will say this on the phone all the time: "We had such a strong connection; we should have been able to work it out."
 
What I want to drill into your head is that no relationship can escape a lot of negativity. Someone eventually gives in. You might know some people who are in a "relationship" that should have ended years ago. In my opinion, those aren’t even relationships anymore. They are just putting up with each other.
When I think back to my relationships, negativity doesn’t always come in the same form from relationship to relationship. For example, some people think that fighting is the main reason why relationships end, which is true because that is a form of negativity. There are more things to consider here.
 
The two main reasons I see a woman leave a man are complacency and insecurity. You can also add choosing the wrong woman in there too, but that’s more general. Many men don’t vet the women in their lives long enough to see the red flags, and even then, they just ignore them.
 
So, what is complacency? 
Well, the dictionary definition is "a feeling of calm satisfaction with your own abilities or situation that prevents you from trying harder."
 
And what is insecurity?
This is the definition of "deficient in assurance: beset by fear and anxiety."
These are the two main reasons I see them in almost every coaching call I have. When I break everything down and get to the root cause, this is what I always see.
Let’s start with complacency.
When the relationship begins, you both try your hardest to maintain that person’s interest in you. Women will dress up and put on more makeup than normal. They will act sweeter and more kind. Men will dress up as well. Act more like a gentleman.
 
As time goes on, we fall into the bad habit of not trying as hard as we used to. So, men stop courting their women. Men will stop trying to figure out what may be going on in the relationship, and they will say, "Ahhh, she will never leave me."
 
I see this all the time. Men and women can both get lazy, but here’s the kicker. Men are the leaders of the relationship! Women aren’t supposed to lead relationships. Men do! Even though our society will say that "happy wife, happy life," the truth is more like "happy spouse, happy house." One of those sayings props one gender up and puts the other one down, and over time we just accepted this. It's crap, and this is exactly what’s wrong with our society. We are complacent as a society too, but that’s not for this book.
 
Men are the directors. Women love it when men take charge and lead. Men who don’t believe this have never been in a relationship where they were the actual leader. Women often test your strength, and as a man, she wants you to pass those tests. Women do this so they can know that you won’t fall in the face of adversity. This is a woman’s way of knowing she chose the right man.
Men have stopped leading. They just "go with the flow," and sometimes that’s a good thing, but since most guys don’t know when that's a good thing and when it isn't, that’s what we need to address.
 
Dating your partner never ends.
 
This is extremely important. So many times, I’ve listened to a guy’s story, and he basically said he got lazy in the relationship and stopped courting her. You can’t stop dating her. I have a video on my channel called "The Perfect Dating Cycle" that shows me taking her out and having a good time. It’s on my masculine energy channel. Check it out and watch it.
 
The idea is that you have three things you need to do. Set the date and time you’re seeing each other. Men today are so lazy, dopey, and soft. They don’t like setting the tone of the relationship. They believe it is the woman's responsibility to do so. It’s not. 
Set the date and make it firm! You must act in such a way that you have extreme abundance in your life. You should be creating this, but that’s for my third book. Set a time and stick to it.
 
So, if it's Monday and you set a date for Thursday, that’s good; you have now set the date in stone, and you shouldn’t move it unless you both agree on a different date. You don’t have to be a robot for this. I want you to know how to do this correctly in the future.
 
This will start to change as she falls more and more in love with you. even if it's an ex or a new woman you're attempting to woo. Attraction and love are tied together like a string (more on this later).
The next part of the date is "showing up." Now, before I go into that, we need to talk about the phone. Texting her the entire time before the date is fucking pointless.
 
Don’t sit on the phone ALL DAY LONG texting a woman. You should be busy working on yourself. I have seen so many dudes mess this up its insane. So many guys think that being on the phone makes them more attractive, but it doesn't. Women like time and space to think about you. Blabbing on the phone just shows her you don't have a lot going on.
 
 
When you text them all day long, it takes away the anticipation of the date. You’re deflating the balloon, so to speak. You will have nothing to talk about, so keep it to a minimum.
Anyway, show up on the date. Have a great time. That is your mission as a man. making the date a great experience for her. This is what I focus on now as a husband to my wife. Not every moment is going to be filled with laughter, but when she is totally in love with you and is just down for you and can’t see herself with someone else, it doesn’t matter what you’re doing. Because YOU are present, you will be enough for her. Getting her to reach this level is the challenge. Being consistent is all there is to it.
 
Positive interaction after positive interaction Positive date after positive date When you do this right, she will eventually fall in love with you because you keep doing the right things. Relationships fail because this dynamic stops.
 
Part 3 of the cycle is "Give Her Space." This is so fucking hard for guys these days, and I honestly didn’t get it for years. Giving her space is a major theme of this book. If you can master your emotions in a relationship, you will be successful. Most men can't handle their emotions when they fall in love.
 
When a man has a problem with a woman, he frequently seeks answers from a woman, which is a mistake. Now some women will tell you the truth, but some wont. So, fellas, GO TO A GUY. A man, a coach, a mentor, a friend, a father!
 
Why?
 
Women don’t always know what or why they are attracted to certain men in their lives. They will go out with men they would tell their daughters to avoid. Women are attracted to strong and capable men, and sometimes those men don’t want just one girl.
Give that girl some space and some time to think about you. Some time to breathe!
You’ve been fooled into thinking that you need to constantly communicate with her for her to like or love you. Space is needed for a relationship to thrive. Think of it as the oxygen for your woodfire.
 
If you find yourself in a relationship with someone who shames you or gets mad at you for having your own life, you are with the wrong person. This is how you naturally give yourself space. Hang out with your boys. Work on your side hustle or business. Go to the gym and workout. Hang out with your friends.
 
One of my students texted me last week, saying, "My girl said she’s tired of me hanging out with my boys." He knew what to do, but he ran it by me anyway. This is what knowing the fundamentals is all about. Many dudes will fail this test and buckle. They will say, "Sorry, hunny, I'll slow down on hanging out with my boys." Wrong move!
 
Now to be clear you should be giving your woman some of your time. It's fine to have 1-3 dates or hangouts per week. Some will demand more, but that’s for you two to decide. Some women want more time with their men.
 
A lot of what makes a successful relationship is balance. I will talk a lot about that in this book series.
 
From here on, you repeat the cycle. Set another date. Give her something to look forward to, and then rinse and repeat steps 2 and 3.
 
A common question I get is "How much space do I give her?" which is a great question. depends on your busy lives. One to 2 days is fine. Sometimes you can go longer, and sometimes you go shorter. Again, once you learn everything you need to know, you can know exactly when to push and when to pull. Complacency is mostly about getting lazy. It’s common for a man to stop courting his girlfriend. If you don’t do it, some other man will eventually.
 
The next thing to consider is complacency on an individual level. Personal goals aren’t being met. Many men have no goals. Zero. NONE!
 
I was also like this at one point because I had no direction or guidance. I give that to men now; still, some get lazy. If she sees you getting fat as hell and not working out, you bitch and complain about your job and how much you hate your boss, etc. Women don’t want to hear this. Strong men don’t sit around complaining and wishing they could change things. They go do it.
One of the most common things I hear during calls is, "I've lost 20 pounds since the breakup," or "I've started that business I always wanted to," or "I've started seeing my friends again like I wanted to."
Are you starting to see what I mean? Women will test men, and weak men will fail those tests. Those men will think, "If I make her happy, she won’t leave or be mad at me. You must be willing to piss off your woman sometimes. I’m not saying to treat her like garbage. She must understand that she cannot change you or prevent you from being a man.
 
Again, I want to say Don’t be a piece of sh*t. Be a good, kind man in this world. We need more of it. But when someone pushes you, PUSH THE FUCK BACK! (i mean this in a metaphorical way not in a physical or violent way. I have to say this because some people are stupid and might take this the wrong way)
 
Ladies will want to know that you are capable of handling it! A woman needs to know that, INSIDE HER SOUL, you will be the best man you can be.
 
You will push hard for the things you want and deserve in life. Too many men have accepted their fate in this life. In book 3, I will discuss how you create your reality. You are the director, actor, and writer of your life.
 
You can take some days off. Again, you’re not a robot and need rest, but always ask yourself this. Are you giving 110 percent to your own goals and life? A relationship is only a certain part of your life. Think about that one.
Insecurity
 
One thing I’ve noticed a lot is how insecure, so many people are in this world. Men and women have never been more insecure, in my opinion. If you're an insecure man, a woman will quickly lose interest in you.
Corey Wayne talks about the James Bond mentality, and I think you should do the same. Masculine-abundant men don’t sit around wondering why a woman is acting a certain way or doing something that seems off. You either entertain it or you don’t.
Guys in my coaching program will say, "She hasn’t reached out all day." "What should I do?" NOTHING! You are an abundant man with options in his life. I will constantly bring up the pillars. For a moment, I will talk about those
The pillars are
•	Health
•	Wealth
•	Personal relationships
•	Self-growth and development
•	Social circle and friends
Most of the time, insecurity is something deeper. When I talk to guys, we get down to the core issue. Insecurity is unresolved trauma. Sometimes it's childhood trauma. Sometimes it’s something more recent.
I have seen so many situations where guys will lose their shit trying too hard to control the outcome of a situation with a girl because they are so afraid of what it will mean if she leaves.
That fear is the driving force behind their bad behavior. Whenever I have a conversation where insecurity is the issue, we talk about something they have experienced in the past that they need to resolve. Since they are trying so hard to control things, they push her further away. That fear is only being realised faster because what you fear will attract you into your life.
These guys will try anything to get women to stay and work on things instead of accepting where they currently are and then working on themselves; they go outward. They go to her.
The first thing we work on is becoming aware of that fear. Knowing it’s there and understanding why It takes a lot of reflection. That is a scary thing to do. From my experience, there is no other way to beat your fears and insecurities other than to face them head-on.
When these guys realise there is nothing to be afraid of, they look back and laugh at how afraid they were.
 
What are these guys usually afraid of? It’s usually these.
•	Abandonment
•	Fear of loss
•	They fear they won’t find someone else.
•	They are afraid they aren’t worthy of love.
Women want to be with men who feel like they are worthy. This is where that whole confidence thing comes from. When a man feels truly comfortable with who he is and what he wants in life, that is what makes him so attractive. Men are supposed to assert themselves in the world and take what they want. More and more men today are afraid to assert themselves.
After you get rid of your fear, life becomes a lot easier. Some people become paralyzed by their fears. A guy in my program didn’t want to date because he was afraid that he would go through another breakup, even though I got him to read and learn the fundamentals. He was scared and paralysed from the pain he experienced.
People will do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure. He eventually did get into a new relationship, and I still coach him to this day to remain in his frame and focus on his goals. He laughs now, looking back at how afraid he once was.
Remember to face your fears. If you’re afraid to talk to women, start by just making eye contact with them. Then move up to just saying hello as they walk by. You will see that most women will not shame you for saying hello to them or making eye contact with them. Little by little, you will see that the fears you have are just in your head.
If this breakup happened to you because of insecurity, know it will take time. I’m not going to lie to you, but I will say that you can 100 percent get through this.

When attraction falls, love falls with it.
 
Guys, if you stop being masculine, she will always lose interest in you.
 
Women are subconsciously keeping track of their attraction to you. A feminine woman is always going to be far more attracted to a very masculine man. A good way to think about this is through a points system.
 
When she first meets you, she will gauge how attracted she is to you. Women know within 5 seconds if they would sleep with you or not. For example, let's say she just met you and thinks you're 82 out of 100. The higher this number is, the more you can get away with for longer, but if you continuously let attraction fall over and over again, no matter how attractive you are, she will dump you.
 
Points are consistently going to go up and down based on your day-to-day behaviour with her. Earlier, I mentioned complacency and insecurity as factors in why she would want to leave you. Negativity in general is going to have an impact on this points system.
 
Let's say you have a really big fight. That fight might have an impact of – 3 on your points.
So, if it was originally 82, you subtracted 3 to get 79. As you can see, if you're constantly fighting and there's negativity lurking around every corner, that number will quickly drop.
 
Just as the number can go down, it can also go up. When you know the fundamentals of attraction, you're going to be able to drive this number up. You drive the number up by having positive, light, and fun dates together. It also goes up when you guys have space. Attraction grows in space; it's like oxygen to a fire. The dates themselves are like wood, and space is oxygen. The spark is already there between you two.
 
Each interaction with your girl needs to drive attraction. That is your mission when you're with your woman. Far too many guys get too serious in their relationships, and with too much seriousness comes fights and negativity.
 
There is a time and a place to be serious, but 5-10 percent of the time is what you're looking for as a ratio. A woman's behaviour toward you is going to be strikingly different when attraction is high versus when it's low. When attraction is high (80–100 on the points system), she will be all over you.
 
She'll be texting you non-stop, wondering what you're doing. This is exactly what feminine energy is all about. They reach out to you for certainty and clarity, and all you have to do is set a date.
 
When attraction is low, that's when she'll be the most distant. As you can see, when a woman's attraction is high, she gets closer, and when it's low, she gets distant.
 
When attraction gets too low, she'll want the ultimate distance, which is obviously a breakup.
Attraction is really the only thing that matters.
 
Maintaining a high attraction level is what will keep your relationship together. A lot of guys overcomplicate what a relationship truly is, so I want to make it as simple as I can for you.
 
ATTTRACTION HIGH = SHE WANTS TO BE CLOSE
 
ATTRACTION LOW = SHE WANTS TO BE APART
 
I know I make this obvious, but most guys just don't get it. It's a very simple concept, but implementing it is harder. A lot of people have a hard time controlling their emotions when in a relationship, so they completely ignore how attraction works.
 
As I previously stated, the ultimate distance is a breakup, so clearly what we need to aim for is increasing attraction. What most guys get wrong during a breakup is how to conduct themselves on a day-to-day basis. a lot of guys will constantly chase and pursue their ex-girlfriend, trying to get certainty, which is feminine energy.
 
When her attraction wanes, she begins to withdraw her attention and love. They begin to think that chasing her and trying to convince her is going to work. In order to get a woman back into your life, she needs to begin thinking and wondering about you.
 
She needs to miss you. 
 
There is absolutely no way that she can miss you if you keep telling her how much you love her, how much you care about her, and how much the time you spent together meant something to you. She already knows all of these things.
 
The more you chase, the more she will run.
 
Whenever guys go through breakups, they constantly apply how their own brains think to their current situation. Men and women operate very differently when it comes to attraction. For women, attraction grows with distance because, in that space and time apart, she has time to think about and wonder about you. She obviously needs to see you, but as the relationship progresses and she gets to know you, some degree of space is important. 
Men are much different because, yes, we do need space from time to time, but we are primarily very visual. This is where the saying "men fall in love with their eyes and women with their ears" comes from.
 
A lot of people don't really want to face this fact, but a relationship oftentimes involves a balance of power. The person who cares more about keeping the relationship together is the one with less power.
 
As much as you might love your wife or girlfriend, if you show it too much without giving her time to wonder about you, it'll just push her away. Stop showing her how much you love her if you want any kind of chance of getting her back.
 
So why do guys think that chasing works? Chasing is the nice guy thing to do, and it's the thing that you've been conditioned to do through music and movies.
 
How many times have you seen in a movie where that guy brings flowers, stands outside with the boom box on his shoulder, displaying his undying love for her, and she falls for him? This is all crap.
 
Women are far more attracted to guys who don't always display their love and affection. This took me a long time to figure out. I used to fall in love with women in the past, and she would consume every thought. I'm sure this is normal to some degree, but it often took the women I was dating by surprise because they assumed I would be less into them. That's why when guys aren't in love with women, they have an easy time attracting them. I had the same issue. Then, when I fell in love, I got goofy and started acting low value.
 
Years ago, I was too nice. Women realised this because they started to see that I cared more about pleasing them than pleasing myself and going after my goals.
 
This took me years to figure out, going through many different relationships and flings. I used to be such a nice guy, and I used to think being nice was actually something to brag about. Being kind and nice isn't the problem in and of itself. It is the act of always putting others first in order to keep them happy at the expense of your own happiness. There is nothing wrong with being kind, but don't let the other person treat you like a doormat.
 
To understand this, you don't always need to be purpose-focused, even though you should be because it makes you attractive. You just need to understand when to show affection and when not to.
Being focused on your purpose and mission makes it easier to pull away because you're not just sitting around waiting for her to message you.
 
The push and pull is much more natural. She is used to the "nice guy" approach. Most guys operate with this mindset. It's completely counter-intuitive, but if you want to raise her attraction level and try to get her back into your life, you have to give her space.
 How men and women operate
 
Men and women are completely different creatures. The things that men value and the things that women value in relationships are also completely different.
 
There are certain things that women are looking for in a relationship. One of those things is the idea of courtship. This is what really turns a woman on. Women aspire to be a part of a love story that unfolds slowly and with some uncertainty.
 
Men can fall in love immediately. They will immediately want to marry a woman based on her looks. Men will meet a beautiful woman and start picturing the kids, the house, the sex, etc. The downfall of men is that they don't take enough time to properly vet women.
 
Women, on the other hand, need to trust you before they will fall in love with you. They also need to respect you a lot before they fall in love with you. Women tend to respect men who give them comfortable vibes. For women, it's all about the experience and discovery.
Her wondering where she stands with you is a massive part of that experience.
Peeling back all the layers, what we're really talking about is masculine versus feminine energy.
Masculine energy is
•	Assertive
•	Bold
•	Discipline
•	Focus
•	freedom seeking
•	focused on resources and money
Feminine energy is
•	Patient
•	Open
•	seeking connection and bonding
•	seeking security
•	seeking stability
•	nurturing
•	compassion
Right now, we have everything backwards because so many men are relationship focused instead of being focused on freedom and independence. There is a ton of societal conditioning going on here through the media, which trains men to act more feminine. I'm sure you've heard this: "Men should open up and be more feminine" or "men should talk about their feelings."
 
The truth is that nobody gives a damn about how men feel. Of course, there are exceptions, but society as a whole doesn't give a damn about man's emotions. On top of all of that, men are being told that embodying certain things like stoicism, acting strong, and being protective is all "toxic masculinity."
 
I'm not trying to get all conspiracy theory on you, but if you look around long enough, you're going to see there's a war against masculinity. I will talk much more in-depth about this in a different book, but for anybody who is reading this, I challenge you to look around a little bit at the narrative being spun about men.
 
It is true that both men and women have masculine and feminine energy inside them. Men's natural essence should be much more masculine than feminine. This independence is actually something that really turns women on. Women actually enjoy being with a man over whom they have no control.
 
Trying to control him is actually a challenge for her. Why do you think they always try to change you when they get into a relationship with you? Think about all those garbage movies like "50 Shades of Grey."
 
If you let them control you, they eventually get to the point where they break up with you because you've changed so much. This is why you can't allow a woman to control you or change you; you must do what you please.
 
Women should never feel like they have you whipped or wrapped around their finger, and they only feel this way if you’re able to say no and stick to your path. Men think that they need to please a woman in order for that woman to love them. This is another mistake that nice guys make because they will do anything to make sure that she is pleased and happy. Anytime a man becomes a pleaser, she will eventually put him in the friend zone. Why? He is too easy. He is too predictable, and most of all, he's boring.
 
These are the guys that constantly buy women flowers and shower them with gifts, thinking that's going to get them laid. Your aim is to be a guy who focuses on his own mission and purpose and can't be controlled by women. Embodying your masculinity is the biggest aphrodisiac for women.
When you're unpredictable, and your feelings are unclear, people will think about you more and then think, "Wow, I must really like this guy." She will constantly talk to her friends about the guy, who is a mystery. The guy that she can't completely figure out.
 
When you have your purpose, it's going to be quite difficult for her to see you all the time. Scarcity creates value. People value you when you're hard to get a hold of. This is going to earn you a lot of respect from her, but it's also going to help you stand out from other men. Most other guys are always available and relationship focused. The fact that you are busy and purpose-driven will catch her off guard.
 
If you really think about it, it's just sales. If you learn sales and the techniques behind sales, you can easily translate it over to dating.
A woman’s emotions
 
Guys have a real hard time understanding women because they are constantly applying their operating system to them. It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole.
 
Women have an emotionally based operating system, and men have a logically based operating system. Men will often say, "We were together for 10 years; how could she just throw this all away?" This is something I hear quite often, by the way, which automatically shows me that the guy I'm talking to over the phone or through e-mail does not understand women.
 
The only thing that matters is how she feels in that moment. When attraction is really high, she'll be all over you like white on rice. Things like the number of years you've spent together or the things you've done for them over the years are irrelevant because she's not interested right now. I will have guys talk to me about how they have completely boosted their woman's life, and they will list off the laundry list of things that they have done for her.
 
Getting over the fact that nothing you've ever done for her matters and that your time together doesn't matter was one of the most difficult things I had to accept when dealing with women. Men love in different ways. Men have the instinct to protect and provide. Since one of the ways that we protect the ones we love is by teaching.
 
When a woman decides to leave, we automatically think that that particular woman did not love us because we taught them so much and did so much for them. I was thrown for a complete loop when I first learned all of this material because of how simple it really all is. That's the thing that messes with guys the most. They can't believe how simple it really is to keep a woman’s attraction high. And if you simply understand that women operate with emotions, you can make any relationship work.
 
Another tough thing for men is to get out of their own way. Sometimes guys have a problem controlling their emotions. When a fight starts with their woman, they can't help but fight back. Fighting with a woman is completely pointless. Women just plain don't fight fair at all. The best way to win a fight is not to have one.
 
MEN ARE LOGICAL
 
WOMEN ARE EMOTIONAL
 
 
Women inherently know they’re a little crazy. They'll openly admit it half the time, especially when they're in a good mood. Men who are successful with women don't let their woman’s emotions affect their mood.
 
If she's disrespectful towards you while she's trying to get some sort of reaction from you, one of the best ways you can respond to that is to say, "I don't appreciate the way you're treating me right now. ""I'm going to take off for awhile, and you can call me when you feel like treating me better." Disagreements happen, but never let a woman piss you off enough to lose your composure. It will not be forgotten.
 
Now that her emotions are all over the place, she wants to be with a man who is centred and strong. This is how relationships balance out between men and women.
 
A woman wants to know that the man she is with is not going to be affected by her emotions. This is exactly why they test you all the time. She wants to know that she can be her complete feminine self and that you'll always be there. She wants you to be her rock and her mountain.
 
The more patient you are as a man, the more attractive you're going to be. Men who try to rush or force things are only revealing their insecurities. Think about it: if you were trying to rush something, which is a common thing men do, that only shows you are affected emotionally by its lack. For example, a man who is rushing into a relationship and pushing her into being his girlfriend instead of letting her bring it up is only showing he needs it in his life.
 
Women are attracted to the exact opposite. They want to be with a man who has a more "take it or leave it" attitude. This isn't to be confused with being aloof all the time, because it's more of a balancing act. The general idea is that you're happy that you have it and that you'd be completely OK without it.
When you are emotionally centred, it shows that you are strong. Women will often test your strength by doing things like pulling away, not answering your text messages as fast as they normally do, and sometimes cancelling plans at the last minute. They just want to see how you're going to react.
 
A woman pulling away throws a lot of my coaching clients off balance, and their entire world falls apart. Most of the time she realises she's losing attraction for you, she's been thinking about it for quite some time, which I will talk more about later in the book.
 
This is why you can't just change her mind through logic and reason; she's already decided that she wants to pull away; she just doesn't know when she's going to do it. When she does pull away, you have to let her pull away. Let her go. Something I learned from one of my favourite mentors, Corey Wayne, is that men are like dogs and women are like cats.
 
Cats will often just roam around, do whatever they want, and come and go as they please. If you try to chase a cat normally, they will simply flee. Push the idea into your head that she will come right back around eventually. Now, with that being said, there are a ton of guys who will wait and hope for the day that the woman comes back around. That's why it's so important for you to be mission focused as a man.
 
Personally, I was lacking in this area for much of my dating life in my early twenties. I didn't really have my own mission or purpose. My mission wasn't actually something that I found; it was more something that I created. I created it around the skill set that I currently had and had developed.
 
I knew that I wanted to get away from the 9-to-5 grind and be my own boss. I started my YouTube channel and a couple of blogs, which have now turned into a pretty big media company. That media company and its growth are now my main mission and purpose. A lot of the time, your mission and purpose are not going to be something that you have always thought you were going to do.
 
You have to remain practical when focused on your mission and purpose. You have to build these skills in order to become successful. A great example of this is a YouTuber.
As a YouTube video viewer, it's difficult to comprehend how difficult YouTube can be. Coming up with an idea, filming it, editing it, and making sure that it's polished is harder than it seems.
 
Day in and day out, you focus on your craft, getting better and better at it each day until eventually you become a master at it. On the blogging side of my business, that's exactly what I did.
 
When you have something compelling in your life for which you wake up early and go to bed late, our relationship is often one of the last things on your mind. As I've gone down this path of becoming more purposeful and mission focused as a man, I've personally seen the quality of my relationships increase.
Putting a woman before yourself will destroy attraction.
 
At the time of writing this book I have probably done 2000 calls and emails. A vast majority of the guys that I speak to over the phone put women before themselves.
 
They will frequently start out very masculine and strong. Guys will literally say to me, "I never used to be this way; I don't know what happened."
This is a massive problem that men are facing, and I think it's because of who men are going to for advice and who they see giving advice. You should only seek advice about women from men, particularly those who are successful with women. There are some women out there who will give you good advice, but generally speaking, you want to go to men.
 
A lot of the time, women don't even really know why they're attracted to certain kinds of guys. They usually give garbage advice like, "Why don't you just tell her how you feel?"
At some point in the relationship, the dynamic flipped. Men will often start off pretty strong and then slowly lose their way. This mainly happens because they develop a "pleaser" mentality over time.
 
Men truly want peace in their households and in their relationships. Eventually, at some point, his woman throws a test at him, and since he does not want to have any conflict, he just does what she wants.
There is the opposite effect when she throws a test at him, and he gets angry and butthurt. You don't want her to have any influence over your emotions. It's hard sometimes, I know, but you can do it.
 
Dating isn't always about making your woman happy. You have to be able to stand up to her in order for her to respect you. Stop putting your wife before yourself. Society will fool you into thinking that making her happy is a man's job. To some extent, it is, but it is not the entire job. Your job is to put yourself out there and set fun dates. These dates eventually lead to the bedroom, and you rent and repeat the cycle.
 
She needs to know that you and I can live without her. She will notice this by the way you carry yourself and your actions. She will love you a whole lot more if she can't control you.
 
The best part of all of this is that it is actually extremely easy because you really just have to focus on yourself. When you are focusing on her, all you have to do is set dates and focus on having a good time with her, then go right back to your business.

The James Bond mentality
 
Something that helps men is thinking about the James Bond mentality. I mentioned this earlier, but it is something that I have reminded myself to do every single day, and it helps with my mindset.
 
If you go back and watch James Bond movies in a nutshell, you're going to see a guy who has a "take it or leave it" attitude.
 
He doesn't take things too seriously. If things need to get serious, he does take them seriously because he's a very capable man, but most of the time, James Bond is very relaxed.
 
This is exactly what we were looking for, and it explains why the women in those films react to James Bond. I know that James Bond is a work of fiction, but he's a great example of what women actually do respond to. Women love to have fun, and James Bond provides a fun experience for all the women he goes after.
 
Bond also remains detached from any kind of outcome and focuses on just being with them. He focuses on the process and has a great time.
 
I would highly suggest going through all the Bond movies and just studying how he responds to situations. You can learn a lot by watching how he carries himself with his body language and his actions.
 
Developing an abundance mindset is one of the most difficult things to do, but it is also one of the most rewarding. It's hard to just turn on the switch, but choices make the difference between us. We all make choices throughout the day, and those choices compound. I choose to make money the way I do every single day, and that energy compounds. I choose to seek a positive life daily, and that compounds.
 
Eventually, your life will completely change because you simply started making different choices. The first choice most of my students make is to just gain more knowledge. They begin to apply that knowledge, and that's when things truly change. Action is the answer to it all. Developing a positive and focused mindset is the key, and for me, the James Bond mindset helps me the most.
 
That indifference is what you're aiming for. It's totally OK to set goals and try to achieve them but remaining detached from the outcome of those goals is important.
 
One example would be if you really want a girlfriend. The harder you try to get one, the harder it's going to be to get one. One of the goals you can set is to go out and approach tons of different women until it happens. Where guys go wrong is when they get rejected, they give up instead of continuing to refine the process.
 
This mentality goes with anything, really. If you want to build a business, you have to set goals and show up every single day. When you hit a road bump, you can't let it crush you. It's OK to have bad days or off days when you can sit at home and just watch a movie, but you should be trying to get right back out there when failure happens.
 
Ever since I found out about Corey Wayne, I have used this to help keep me focused. I keep this on my wall, among other things.
 
WWJBD - WHAT WOULD JAMES BOND DO?

Being able to walk away.
 
This is critical to retaining a woman's interest in you over time. It's going to be extremely hard for women to faze you if you're always willing to walk away from the relationship.
 
One of the best things I ever learned was to be able to walk away and mean it. This works in relationships, business, sales, etc. Right now, you're most likely reading this book because you're going through a breakup, and your girlfriend has walked away from the table.
 
If you take a look at how you're feeling, this is what happens when you're able to walk away and mean it. I talk to guys every single day who have no idea what to do, and all they want is their ex back.
Being able to walk away is extremely powerful, and most of the time the person you're with will fold.
Another example of this is that, inside my company, I provide SEO services.
 
Sometimes the clients I work with will try to talk down my price. I am absolutely not willing to move on my price. I understand the value of what I provide since it helps businesses grow over the long run.
 
If you apply this to a relationship, if somebody walks away from you, you must do the exact same thing. You have to understand your value and what you have to offer.
 
This is exactly what will bring an abundance mentality into your life. When you understand your value, people will think twice about disrespecting you and hurting you.
 
Everything begins with choice. If you choose to let people into your life that take away your happiness, that is exactly what you will get. Unhappy people love to bring others down with them. Misery really does love company.
 
Years ago, I had a lot of negative people in my life that needed to be cut out. Some of them were trying to bring me down the same path as them. Some of them were addicted to drugs. Some of them were always drunk. Some of them were just always complaining about stupid shit.
 
I remember telling a friend of mine I wanted to start a business, and he just laughed at me. He literally said, "Starting a business is hard; what would people buy from you?" His tone came off like he thought I was stupid. I eventually realised that nobody else really thought like I did. They were thinking small, and I was trying to think big.
 
You might have people in your life who are like this. Some of them could even be family members. Now, I'm not telling you to cut them out completely, but you need to keep your distance from them. They won't help push you forward.
 
Obviously, this includes women. If you're going to spend several hours a week with someone, they should be a complement to your life, not an anchor. So many women are going to be anchors, fellas. How do you know if your wife is an anchor?
 
Does she support you? Does she try to help elevate you? Does she even ask about how you're doing?
 
I’ve shown weakness; how do I turn it around?

I was totally guilty of this as well, so don't feel too much shame, fellas. Heartbreak is a strange thing and makes people do weird shit.
 
A lot of guys come to me, and they've already shown a lot of weakness. Some of them begged and pleaded for several weeks before they came to me.
 
Some of the guys I've coached have shown up at her workplace. Some guys will show up at their family members' houses. Some guys will hang around spots where they think she will be.
When you have dug a lot of holes, it is difficult to pull yourself out of them, but the first thing you have to do is stop. Stop chasing, stop pursuing, and stop showing up.
 
Space is your best friend right now. Earlier, I mentioned that she needs to be wondering about you. There's absolutely no way that she can wonder about you if you're always in contact with her. especially if the contact is unwanted.
 
You're giving away all of your power, and the more that you fail to control yourself, the less attracted she's going to be to you.
 
Don't sit around all mad at yourself because you couldn't control yourself either. Chalk it up to not knowing any better and move on from it.
 
I've seen too many guys beat themselves up for several weeks and even months. It's just keeping you at a low vibration and stopping you from focusing on the things that you really do need to focus on to improve yourself.
 
One really bad thing that guys do is beat themselves up for getting weak in the first place. Just stop doing that. There is no point in beating yourself up for not being able to control yourself right now. Sure, you probably should have known better, but if you weren't taught how to do all the things in this book, it's not really your fault.
 
It is your fault that you are aware of this information but choose to ignore it. Some people have sticky belief systems. Some people need to get hit hard with pain before they finally challenge an old belief system.

As a man, it's your duty to be strong.
 
Women only want to be with strong men. That's just the way it is. Women will test this strength as they get to know you. When a relationship is just beginning, men don't really have too much leverage or power because women hold the keys to sex. Men hold the keys to relationships.
 
In the beginning, women don't really want a relationship because they don't know you. Women know that men want sex. Women will frequently play hard-to-get in order to maintain power.
 
For a man to counteract this, he has to not care about the outcome of his plans with her. Indifference is what makes the difference here. When a man approaches a woman, she knows what he wants, and it ends up turning into a game of who gives in first.
 
As a man, you cannot give in first. Your indifference is actually going to be very attractive because the very idea that you don't really care about the outcome makes a woman feel safe.
 
Women need to feel safe and comfortable around you in order to sleep with you. You've probably heard a girl say, "Oh my God, that guy is so creepy," at some point in your life. This is what you do not want her to think about you. Guys who come on too strong and act too needy trigger alarm bells.
Guys who don't have many options with women are going to act desperate and needy. That desperate energy is what she's afraid of.
 
Doing this is also going to help you stand out as a man. Just remember to be patient when you're dating a woman Especially in the beginning, because she is going to throw most of her tests at you in the beginning.
 
Before you go on to the next part, I want you to understand that I know what it's like to come from a weak mindset. Some of you may be strong in certain aspects of your life and weak in others.

Sometimes it can feel like it will take forever for you to get to the desired stages of your life. Take it one day at a time. That’s it. If you try to rush your way to success, you will fail and fail hard.
 
Everyone is in a hurry to get things for some reason. You will become who you need to be through DAILY work.

What to do when a woman decides to pull away from you.
 
Since you're reading this book, I'm guessing that you're in this situation right now. The first thing you shouldn't do is panic. Over 90% of men have no idea what to do when a woman decides to pull away. Most men begin to panic and try to change your mind with logic and reason. I have coached guys that are the most masculine of men, but they don't understand what to do when their woman pulls away, and they crumble.
 
How you handle her pulling away will either reinforce her wanting to stay with you long term or reveal that she's just with the wrong guy. If you really sit down and think about it, it makes total sense why women want to see what you're made of. As a man, you're supposed to provide and protect, and if a woman is able to completely crumble you, then what is the rest of the world going to do to you?
It's not like women are conscious of this; it's more of a subconscious thing. They want to make sure that the person they're going to mate with is the best of the best.
 
Over the years, I have seen tons of different situations. Some of the guys that I help are actually pretty high-value, but they just don't understand female nature and/or attraction skills enough, so they don't know what to do when their girl pulls away.
 
In my experience, a woman will go cold in almost every single relationship at some point. I think it's part of their nature; it's just impossible for them to always be hot for you. Some women out there will simply go cold just to keep things interesting and refreshing. You cannot take her going cold personally. Just make sure that you're constantly working on your purpose and yourself.
 
Why is she pulling away from you?
 
In order to fix any kind of distance issue, you must understand why she might be pulling away and putting distance between you.
Reason #1: She is losing interest in you.
This right here is one of the main reasons why she starts getting distant and cold toward you. Whether your relationship is really long or short, attraction must remain high in order for you to stay together.
 
Too much negativity over a long period of time tends to reduce attraction.
 
Negativity usually comes in the form of complacency, insecurity, and a general lack of understanding of how women operate. A great example of that is fighting. Fighting with a woman is completely pointless because it doesn't lead anywhere. It's really just a form of communication.
 
When two people fight, they're trying to get their point across to the other person. Sometimes one individual isn't listening or doesn't care. A fight will break out, and usually somebody will get loud or say hurtful things.
When a woman loses attraction for you, she will eventually go cold and stop talking to you. When a woman's attraction to you is really high, they want to be around you more. It can be difficult for a woman to return once the attraction has faded, especially if the man is inexperienced. You have to be able to handle the breakup properly by knowing when to push him and when to pull.
She is very busy.
Sometimes people forget that their significant other has an individual life, or they have expectations that they put on their significant other, and they drop certain priorities for the relationship.
This is very common among college and university students.
 
Guys will call me because their girls are pulling away, and the first thing I'll ask is, "Is she doing exams right now?"
 
When somebody pulls away from you, it's very hard not to take it personally. People will start seeing every little thing as an attack on them. When somebody has a busy individual life, something in their life has to give in order to fit their priorities. Most of the time, the relationship needs to take a backseat until whatever is taking up their focus starts to burn away. School doesn't really last that long (at least the intense part like exams), so if she's pulling away from you, the general idea that you have to take away from this is that you have to remain cool and calm.
 
So many guys freak out, and the women that they are with end up going, "Is this the same guy?"
It completely takes women by surprise when a man acts out of pocket.
 
A lot of the time, the beginning of a relationship can take so much time and energy that other priorities in her life have taken a backseat, like friendships and family time, and she may want to put some more time and energy into those things that matter.
 
Don't take it so seriously and just focus on yourself for a little while. stay relaxed!
She is testing you.
Women test for many different reasons, and sometimes those reasons matter and sometimes they don't. Sometimes women will test you because they think that you're weak and they want you to step up. Sometimes they test you just because they want to start a little fire and make things exciting. The point is, you have to handle the tests properly in order to keep her attraction high or even raise it.
If you let your emotions get the best of you, your attraction will fall. She wants to know that the man she is with will not be moved by her actions or what she does. The man is supposed to be the rock, the mountain, the place she can go for comfort. if she tests you and she begins to get colder on you, you are failing her tests.
She doesn't want to get hurt.
I often see this when a woman has gone into a new relationship, and she hasn't gone over the old relationship yet. She will not want to rush into things because she's afraid to get hurt because the last relationship burned her so badly.
She may even still talk to this X from time to time, which is just going to bring back those painful memories and emotions for her. A part of us even knows that she can't go back to him or even have him in her life anymore, but she won't want to commit, or she might put up walls before she commits.
Sometimes those walls come in the form of cold and distant behaviour because she's trying to figure out her emotions and figure out what she's going to do going forward. She may really like you, but a relationship is about individual people coming together to share their lives together. if one of those individuals is not ready to do so, there is no relationship.
I see a lot of guys wanting to force a woman to be ready, which is obviously not right. This is what happens when we want something so badly that we try to bend people's free will in order to satisfy our needs and wants.
The truth is, we have to figure out why we want these things so badly, figure out why we feel like we lack them, and heal that. When you heal your issues, you will be far more appealing to the opposite sex, and you will not have a lack, and a relationship will flow very naturally.
She is interested in somebody else.
When a woman begins to pull away, this is usually the first thing that goes through a guy's mind. Now, sometimes this actually does happen, and what women will sometimes do is what's called "monkey branching," which is when they get into another relationship before letting go of the old one. She will start creating distance between the old relationship and the old guy, and then she will start hanging out with the new guy more and more.
Usually at the same time, the guy begins to chase and pursue, making him look even weaker and further reinforcing her decision to leave.
That's why it is imperative that when a woman walks away from you, you mirror her actions and continue to work on yourself.
It is extremely hard to accept the fact that your girl may be seeing another guy. The first thing that pops into our heads is the fact that she might be having sex with somebody else.
She has an avoidant personality.
People with avoidant personalities have a hard time forming connections and bonds with other people. There is a theory out there called attachment theory, and there are a few different types of personality traits. One of those is the avoidant type.
If this is your girl, she's going to have a hard time forming a bond with you, which is really important in keeping her interested and keeping the intimacy alive. Sometimes what will happen is that they will actually start forming a bond with you and then they will pull away, and sometimes they pull away more often than a normal woman would.
The mistake that guys often make is thinking that they can change her. They believe that love will conquer all, which is nonsense.
 
I do a lot of calls with a lot of guys, and a lot of those guys live in fantasyland, trying to avoid reality because it hurts. I understand you may be really interested in a girl, and you really want it to work out, but the longer you live in fantasyland and avoid reality, the longer it will take for you to find a girl who really does want to be there.
 
A coaching student of mine was so obsessed with this one girl who didn't really want him but just kept him in the friend zone and gave him the false belief that something would eventually happen. He fell for it for several months, and instead of circulating and focusing on dating new women who were actually interested in him, he just focused on her.
 
Rejection does breed obsession, so he wanted to figure out why she didn't want him instead of just getting back out there and talking to new girls. Some guys get so fixated on one particular woman that they forget to live their lives. Fellas. If one girl doesn't want you, move on!
She's been thinking about breaking up with you for some time.
Before women leave you, they will often think about it for several days, weeks, months, and sometimes years, depending on how long the relationship was. Like I said earlier, too much negativity will breed a breakup. If things aren't going in a positive direction, she will lose faith in the relationship and want to break up with you.
 
Women don't really want to stay in situations that don't suit them and help propel things forward. I mean, why would they? It makes no sense. Men often stay in relationships that no longer serve them much longer than women do. There is a lesson in that.
 
When she loses attraction for you, her respect for you will also drop, and she'll start becoming more disrespectful and even mean. People do this sometimes because they want you to break up with them so they don't feel guilty about breaking up with you. The hardest part about all this is that she's not even going to tell you that she's feeling this way; she's just going to treat you with disrespect, which is sometimes a test. Sometimes guys get so wimpy in their relationships that they forget to stand up for themselves, and their women want them to stand up for themselves. No woman wants to be with a weak man who won't stand up for himself.
You could argue that women's testing is actually a very good thing for us men because it keeps us sharp and in our masculine frame. However, that being said, men only want to do that for high-quality women.
She won't be able to hide her feelings forever, and she will eventually break up with you if she feels like the relationship is not going in a positive direction.
Giving her space and ending contact
 
If you want the best chance of reattracting your girlfriend, the best thing that you can do right now is to completely end all contact and give her some space.
 
I know this is completely counterintuitive to what you think will work, but this is the best way.
Every single guy that comes to me for coaching always wants to chase her and try to convince her through logic that breaking up is a bad idea.
 
Some of these guys are wondering how to get a girl back, but they're still so relationship focused that there is no reason she should come back. Relationship-focused men are less attractive and more predictable.
 
A lot of guys don't even realise how bad their relationship is until the breakup hits them right in the face. One of the most common things I hear is, "Everything was great in the beginning; I don't know what happened." Most guys are completely oblivious to when a girl is losing attraction for them, and this is one of the first things that you have to learn.
 
Space is the number one thing that's going to help get her thinking of you in a more positive manner. The problem comes from men who can't walk away, which is about 95% of men.
Most men are just too weak to actually stick to no contact. They just want to know so badly what's going to happen so they can prepare themselves, but the truth is, you don't even really need to. You don't need validation. Validation is something that women chase after, not men.
 
What I'm saying is that if you are a man and you're seeking validation, you're acting feminine, which is exactly what people who break no contact are doing. This is sometimes disguised as closure.
 
I've talked to thousands of men at this point, and a lot of them think that closure or something that they actually truly want is really what they want—one more chance to convince her to change her mind. They play it like a movie in their heads, where they think they could convince her that it's a good idea to stay with him.
 
99% of the time, the man let her chase in the beginning of the relationship before beginning to chase himself. When men develop feelings for women, they begin chasing. This is usually brought on by a scarcity mindset. There are a ton of guys running around right now with a scarcity mindset because they don't work on themselves, so abundance just isn't in their lives.
 
When men fall in love, they basically want to be around their girls 24/7, and this is only going to backfire because space is really where attraction grows. when they have the time to think about you and wonder about you.

The Clingy Man
 
Women are extremely turned off by clingy men. It's mostly to do with the fact that they can't control themselves emotionally. Most guys have no idea how to control themselves when they're in love. which is exactly why I always hear, "Everything was great in the beginning; I don't know why I was dumped." 99% of the time, they dumped us because they fell in love and had no idea how to control themselves.
 
A lot of guys think that when they are in love with a woman, they need to be around her 24/7 in order to keep her in love with him. The truth is that attraction and love grow in space, not when you're around each other. Those men will constantly reach out and chase her, not giving her any time to wonder about him. This is feminine energy, and the more feminine energy you show her, the more turned off she is going to be.
 
It's OK to love your girl, but you have to understand when to pull back and when to push forward. When guys are in love, they get goofy and want to spend every waking minute around their girl. It's extremely important that you pull back and focus on yourself and your masculine energy.
 
Sometimes doing nothing is one of the most powerful things that you can do, and this is also something that most men cannot do. look back at what feminine energy is. When she has the time to wonder about you, she will want to connect with you because she constantly thinks about you. If you're around all the time and chasing her, she's not going to have any time to think about or wonder about her feelings.
 
So in order for you to get the most out of your relationships and, of course, breakups, you want to instil space and focus on yourself. I know that the worst thoughts are going to go through your brain when you let go and give her space, but the truth is, you have no idea what she's going to be doing, so there's really no point in fearing it because you can't stop it regardless.
 
One thing you always have to remember is that chasing and pursuing never works, and if it does, she will only pity you, and that's not what you want. She needs to respect you, just as she will respect you if you're able to give her space without crying like a little baby.
 
Typically, men who are clingy are dealing with some underlying issue. They are attracting what they fear the most. This is a fear of abandonment. This will cause severe self esteem issues as well.

Your fantasy about love
A lot of guys have a specific idea of what love really is. They are learning it from the movies and the music that they've been bombarded with since they were young.
 
Love and attraction are bound together. 
 
A lot of guys think that when a girl falls in love with them, she will stay attracted to them and love them forever. This invites a lot of laziness in a relationship because a lot of guys will sit there and go, "Oh, I got this whole relationship thing down. I don't need to focus on it anymore."
 
One of the biggest reasons why relationships end is complacency. The truth is that attraction is far more important than you might think. Think about the way your girl was when she was totally in love with you and attracted to you. She was all over you like white on rice. As the attraction started to fade, so did her love. This is when she will say things like, "I love you, but I'm not in love with you."
 
To remain attractive in her eyes, it's just a matter of understanding a few core fundamentals, and they're really not that difficult to implement.
 
Men seem to believe that they must constantly do something in order for her to remain in love with them, when in fact, doing nothing and simply staying away from her will increase her attraction far more than being around her will.
 
Since people think in extremes these days, I'm not going to say that you can't see her, but you don't want to be spending 24/7 with your girl. Set a couple dates a week, and that's it. Her feminine energy is going to want to bond with you and connect with you more and more. In my opinion, you should always leave her wanting a little more.
 
Mix it up. Some weeks you can see her four times that week, and other weeks you can see her three times. Throw in a week where you only see her once, and for the love of God, stay off the phone!
 
Attraction grows when you guys are apart NOT TOGETHER
 
Something dudes really don't understand is how attraction grows and wanes. Spending too much time together is actually going to be a bad thing because it gets too easy for her. You might have heard this come from a woman's mouth before: "He's boring." Women say this about men: that they have it completely figured out, which is why you want to take time and space from each other.
 
keeping a woman Guessing is the most effective way to keep a woman interested over time. 99% of the time that guys reach out to me, they have a problem sustaining attraction. Normally, these guys have no trouble attracting women, but when they fall in love, the problems begin.
 
What you need to do is think about how much time you're spending together and ask yourself, "Have I been much of a mystery?" I understand it sounds like a game, but frankly, that's what it is. Women want to mate with the strongest man that they can find, and men who have nothing going on are usually the ones who are the most relationship focused. When a man is relationship focused, he puts zero space between him and her. Do you see how everything fits together? A lack of space will turn her off and kill the relationship pretty quickly. So burn this into your memory: women need time to wonder about you while they are away from you.
 
A lot of guys have a real tough time accepting the fact that women need time away from them, but really, it helps you more than it hurts you. You get to focus on you! I remember having a hard time accepting this when I was learning it because it was my ego.
 
I kept thinking to myself, "What is wrong with me? but it's just the way that they are. Women will tell you with their actions exactly what's going on in their minds. When they want to be close to you, they text you and call you so that you can make plans with them and see them. That is what feminine energy is all about. She puts herself in your orbit so that you can make a move.
Every day, your job is to constantly improve yourself. Once you accept this and actually start putting in that work, everything will come together.
 
During many of the coaching calls that I have with guys, I will ask them what is going on in their lives. It's always the same. Most of the guys actually have nothing exciting going on at all. There's nothing new that they're trying to learn. no new skills. nothing exciting at all.
It's your job to focus on your life. It's not like you have to take on some gigantic, daunting task; all you have to do is improve just a little bit every day.
 
What are the chances of her coming back?
 
This is probably the most common question they get on a call. I hate to say it, but it depends. Did you start giving her space after the breakup? How long has everything been going wrong? There are about a million questions that I could ask and get a good idea of what your chances are, but there is no guarantee.
 
If you chased, begged, and pleaded with her, your chances are much lower than if you just gave her space and accepted the breakup. She needs to think that it's a good idea to come back to you. Someone who begged her and made himself look weak gives her zero incentive to come back.
 
Like I said earlier, women want to be with strong men, and a man who begs for anything is a weak man with no power. If you handled it correctly, your chances of hearing from her are very good.
If she has some other guy on the side, then it's going to take much longer or may never happen. The point is that when you're faced with a breakup, you have to focus on yourself and turn your life into the awesome one that it should be.
 
Searching for certainty is only going to make you attached to the outcome of the situation. Whenever you're dealing with relationships, there are no guarantees. Humans want to avoid risk and pain, which I totally understand, but when you face your fears head-on, you become so much stronger.

How to properly cut the contact
 
One of the best ways that you can cut contact is by saying that you agree with the breakup and that you have some things that you need to work on. Many of you are going to see this Ann reads this after the breakup has happened, so one of the things you can say is, "You know, it's probably a good idea that we actually break up because I have things that I need to work on."
 
This works well because it actually shows that you are working on yourself and working on things that you know you need to work on. This will drive respect up to a degree because women like it when men work on themselves.
 
If you're in a situation where you and your ex are still in contact and it's going nowhere, you need to stop contacting them NOW!
 
When someone leaves you, they aren't going to say no to free attention and validation. Why would they?
 
They LOVE knowing you're still there in case they want to come back to you. Over the years, many men have come to me when they get dumped, and they will tell me they have been in contact with their ex for the past 3, 5, or 10 months! sometimes even longer.
 
They have ZERO pressure on them to make a decision about you. They basically turned you into their little plaything. Do you enjoy that?
 
This is where you need to get tough on yourself and really think about what you want to do. Many guys don't want to face their ex because they're afraid of what will happen.
 
Fear will hold you back. For 99 percent of situations you need to walk away and let them FEEL your absence. its scary i know but its necessary.

What to do if your ex reaches out to you
This is where most guys freak out and lose their shit. The first thing you need to do is not display any form of weakness. The weakness in this case is showing her how much you care and love her.
 
So when she texts you, just make sure you don't answer the phone too quickly. Let's say she texts at 3:00pm. You should respond later on, around 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. This displays high value behaviour because it seems like you're busy doing something important. Most people are on their phones 24/7, so this will help you stand out.
 
Another thing you should do is make certain that when you do respond to her, you do not send her a long message back. Less is definitely more here.
 
Most of the time, her message will be some form of small talk. "Hey" or "Hey, how are you" or "How have you been?"
 
Keep it simple by responding with something like, "I'm doing well. keeping busy" or "I'm doing well, thank you, and I hope you're doing well."
 
What she's usually doing is gathering information. She wants to see if you're going to respond. From here, the conversation will change.
 
One of the things that will happen is that she will want to meet you and see you in person. This is the best-case scenario. Make sure you push the date out a little bit. I know you're going to be nervous and excited.
 
You want to remain as neutral as possible and push the date out. Push it for a few days and see how she responds to you. If she gives you a lot of pushback and wants to see you sooner, then we have exactly what we're looking for. You want her to be pushing to see you. Sometimes women realize they made a mistake by leaving you, but this only happens if you don't chase after her and give her the breakup. From here, you GO SLOW and set a date, and go see her. Prioritize having fun and not being serious.
 
The next thing that will happen is that she will reach out to you, and when you do respond, she will just stop messaging you. Women love to know they can still get you, which is why they do this. They want to see if you will still respond to them or not. Let her back off and come back to you. Do not chase her.
 
Be careful not to engage in a long conversation with her. This will kill all the tension she is feeling. If she is beginning to realise she has made a mistake, she will be concerned about you moving on and losing you forever. However, it takes time for her to want to engage her emotions again, so she needs to feel the anxiety for some time before she is ready to commit.
 
Long conversations kill that tension. So have a short exchange back and forth, and then get off the phone and work on your mission.

Focus on your sexual market value.
During no-contact, you're going to have a lot of time on your hands to focus on yourself. This is the most common thing that coaches say, and it is true, but they don't always tell you exactly what you need to focus on.
 
You need to focus on your attraction and how attractive you are. not just physically. You need to work on everything. physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. They all work together in harmony. While working on these things, do not reach out to her.
 
A common question is, "Should I tell her I'm working on myself? "Or "should I tell her I'm backing off and working on myself?" This question is asked by guys who didn't initiate no contact right away. If this is you, then you should just back off without saying anything.
 
She will be used to hearing from you, so when she says something to you, just say, "You know what, you broke up with me, and it's just not right for us to continue talking like this. ""I definitely don't want to be your friend, so I will be focusing on myself."
 
Women love to continue talking to you after a breakup because they are starting to see you as a friend. They lost your attraction, and when that happens, they automatically try to demote you. Some women won't, but most will.
 
Becoming attractive again is so key, and it really has nothing to do with your ex. It's all about you. You want to stand out as a man. When you feel the most attractive, you'll have the right energy. In my opinion, confidence is just being in the right pocket of energy.
 
anyone who has played sports or even video games. When you're confident, you're doing well. I used to play football. I played running back, and when I was at my most confident, it was like I could read the minds of the players on the field. It's like I knew what they were going to do before they did it. If they caught me off guard, I was still able to get some yards.
 
I also game sometimes and when I do and I'm in the right energy, I totally slap the other team.
 
You can get into this energy again. Right now, you're experiencing the exact opposite of this energy. It's going to feel like you can't do anything right at all.
 
Focus on the physical stuff first. Fellas SMASH THE GYM. Get in there every single day. Go twice if you have to. The more you get into your body and the more you're breathing heavily, the less you will think about her and the relationship. There is a wealth of fitness information available on YouTube. Just stick to the simple stuff. Eat good food 90 percent of the time and exercise a lot.
 
The emotional stuff is the hardest to focus on because it comes in waves and is unpredictable. Do what you can to help yourself here. Hitting the gym helps with the emotional stuff too. The more you get into your body, the better off you will be. Intense exercises are key for this.
 
Rebuilding your confidence is the end goal, so you can get back into that pocket of energy. Women feel this energy. They can tell if it's there. This is why you need to spend time away from her and give her space. She will be able to sense your frustration. Confidence comes from being competent in different areas of life. A capable man who can control his emotions is what she's looking for.
 
A few confidence tips I give my students are: Work out hard and stick to a healthy diet. You will trim down and lose weight, which makes you look better. Make sure your hair and beard are trimmed and looking nice.
 
Make sure you wear clothes that fit you and look good on you. You want to look as good as you can. If you take care of your looks While learning about female nature and attraction skills, you might have another woman look your way. This has happened to me many times. You may not even want her, but it will make you feel really good knowing other women are looking at you.
 
You will literally be increasing your SMV (sexual market value) because other women are going to want you. All women want to be with a valuable man. Now if you're able to post on social media about your progress without looking like a dude fishing for compliments, then it will display your work. Don't be that guy who posts ONLY for her to see. Do it for yourself.


 
I WENT INTO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS BUT WANTED TO DEDICATE THE REST OF THE BOOK TO JUST DEALING WITH THE BREAKUP ITSELF

Your breakup
 
There are different things you will see during your breakup. You will experience many different emotions, ranging from pure sadness to pure anger. You may even feel happy for a brief moment, only to be reminded of her 5 minutes later, and your sadness returns. It's normal to be like that during this time of uncertainty.
 
Right now, all you care about is your ex and what she’s doing. Who is she talking to? Who is she with? Is she fucking some other guy? You will think of every possible scenario. Days feel like weeks, and weeks feel like months. Time has been extended for you, but it is normal for them.
I promise you, it gets easier and easier as time passes. What you need to think about is what you’re doing with the time you have. Are you doing anything productive? Many guys do know the reason for the breakup. They will admit it to me during our calls together. Then they'll sit around for weeks, doing nothing to figure out what caused it.
 
Now, I’m not saying you need to be a go getter all the time. You do need to grieve, and sometimes sitting around is just the right medicine. Right now, just incorporating movement is the best thing you can do. Get in the gym and get outside as often as possible. Get into your body.
 
Going through a breakup can be the absolute worst thing ever. I remember feeling like I would rather have a broken bone or anything else happen. The uncertainty is what kills you.
You don’t know when you’re going to feel better. Nothing really takes away the pain until one day you wake up and it doesn’t hurt as much as it did.
 
A lot of guys will say to me, "Did she ever love me?" "What could I have done to keep her in my life?"
Later in the book, I will have a whole section of FAQs.
.
If anyone on this planet decided to spend time with you, they must have loved you to a certain degree. Time is the one thing we cannot get back. One thing I’m trying to point out in this book is that love isn’t what you think it is. When I talk to guys, they think love is the Disney version of love.
 
They think of that kind of unfading love, and they believe that the last girl they were with is THE ONE.
 
There is no such thing as "the one. That was made up by weak people who create media. The guys and girls who write movies, music, and TV shows. They are writing the way they wish love was. Usually, it’s the people who can’t find a great partner who write these fantasies.
 
There are TONS of different women you will resonate with on this planet. If you still don’t believe me, Think of all those times your woman has told you how much she loves you, and now she’s leaving?
The breakup experience will leave you feeling like absolute sh*t and totally clouded. I like the word "clouded. Many guys that have been through my coaching program will say how much clearer they see things after a few months.
 
Cloudiness is what emotions do to you. When you’re emotional, you can’t think clearly. The number of times I’ve had to tell guys not to message a girl post breakup because they think they can just talk her into coming back is shockingly huge.
 
I will often get this question: "How do I stop feeling this pain?" The short answer is: you don’t.
You are going through this for a reason. You must. Pain is a part of life and how humans learn lessons. Everyone wants to skip the painful part because it hurts and sucks. How else do you learn anything?
Humans are retroactive by nature. That is, we learn as we go, and we learn from our mistakes. Most people are not proactive by nature. Going through enough pain will make you proactive because you will want to avoid pain.
 
One of the things the guys in my program start learning is female nature. How women operate and how they work without hating them. There is a lot of media out there trying to convince you that women are the enemy. They aren’t. What you must learn is how to choose and keep a high-quality woman. This also comes with the territory of "why should she choose you? That’s for a later chapter, though.
Embrace the pain. It sucks. It will eventually go away; I promise you that. I know you want to hear that there is some magic formula that I can tell you that will make it all disappear tomorrow, but that’s not how life works.
 
We must learn from this experience so you can reflect and think about how you can do it better next time. That is exactly how life is structured. Some of the things we go through are on a smaller scale of pain. I remember the first time I put on a pair of skates. Skates to go skating on ice for anyone who might think I’m talking about roller skates.
 
I had a problem with stopping. I always thought I would break my ankles if I tried stopping at a high speed. What I didn't realise is that it's a technique. Once you learn it, you’re no longer scared. Eventually, it became so second nature to me that I could stop without thinking about it. It became like walking.
 
This is what will happen if you decide to go down the path of letting go and learning how to deal with attachments and emotions. Breakups won’t have such a deep cutting effect on you because you know the rules. You understand how women work. You understand how attraction works, and if the relationship falls apart, you just move right on through life.
 
Attachments create suffering. You have all these plans together. I'm here to tell you that none of those things matter. The time spent together doesn’t matter. You can be with a woman for 10 years, 20 years. It doesn’t matter. Women operate completely differently than men.
 
Breakups are different for women. Women and men have different operating systems. Men tend to think more logically and women more emotionally. Men will think they can just say something, and it will change her mind suddenly. More Disney thinking It doesn’t work that way. When a woman falls out of love with you, it takes time, just like falling in love with you did.
 
If you got dumped today, let’s say She’s been thinking about it for quite some time now. could be days, weeks, or months now. Years, in some cases. Like I said before, too much negativity will cause this thought pattern. When that happens, she starts thinking, "Why should I be with this guy?"
 
Men with their logical brains think, "Hey, we’ve been together for x amount of time; we should be able to work this out." Nope. She must feel like it’s a good idea to come back around to you. This perfectly leads into my next point.

The dumper’s brain and how they feel
 
The dumpee feels the most pain at the beginning, while the dumper tends to feel it later. The dumpee will often fight with the dumper, saying things should be worked on instead of thrown away.
Again, this is the logical brain trying to rationalise an emotional person. No matter what you say or do, they won’t be swayed. This will come as a shock to you as you realise more and more that you have no power anymore. That loss of power is extremely difficult to come to terms with.
 
You used to be able to talk things out at one point, but now they have walked away from the negotiating table. Your ex will come across as cold. This is also the time that dudes will come to me thinking that their ex is a narcissist (more on that later).  How is it that they can so easily forget about all our love and memories together? This is a frequently asked question, and I've said it before, but I'll say it again. They’ve been thinking about it for a long time now. a lot longer than you think. which means they’ve had time to think about what life would be like without you. They’ve thought about being free and possibly being with someone else.
 
It's completely new to you, but to them, it’s a long time coming. especially if the negativity I mentioned before continues. For most of my coaching clients, this revelation is a huge shock. They are usually left in disbelief, and I say this to them. If you think back, you can most likely pinpoint where it began.
When someone loses attraction and respect for you, they will usually gradually withdraw from you. make themselves less available. They will create more and more distance, and usually it's too late by the time you realise it.
 
The dumper slowly realises they are no longer in love and decides to "take space" from you. You will hear many different excuses, but this is a major one. Women especially don’t always know why they are turned off by what you’re doing or not doing, so they distance themselves. To be honest, it makes sense. Where guys get frustrated is with the lack of communication that's happening.
 
Women don’t want to tell you how to make yourself attractive to them. They just want it to be so.
I coached hundreds of men over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these men were lost. didn’t have jobs because the economy was tanking. Many of them got lazy, sat around, and fell into complacency.
 
These guys were struggling to get themselves together, and many relationships ended because they simply didn’t know what to do with themselves. Women do not want to teach men how to be men. Women want to be part of a love story, so to speak.
I'll be honest. Some of the men I speak with on the phone are looking for mother substitutes in their girlfriends or wives. They just want to be taken care of and coddled.
After they get off the phone with me, they realise how silly they’ve been acting and scramble to re attract their ex.
 
Of course, a relationship can end suddenly. Usually, it’s because of something major like abuse, cheating, or something else that is traumatic.
 
Sometimes a bad argument can lead to a breakup. I’m saying that most of the time, when someone leaves you, they’ve been thinking about it for quite some time.
 
Losing trust that the relationship will work is what really kills a relationship. Somewhere, sometime in the relationship, doubt and fear will creep in. When this happens for too long, it will change everything.
 
Many of the problems I see when doing coaching involve the woman losing faith, trust, and respect for her man. She starts to doubt his masculine frame. It always starts with something small that causes the first little bit of doubt. After she sees it more and more, she will begin to test and see if it changes.
Most guys completely fail these tests. That doubt continues to grow, and eventually a breakup happens. Like I said before, an easy way to frame it is with just too much negativity.
 
There are tons of reasons for these thoughts to begin to form.
•	a mediocre sex life
•	Too much arguing
•	Too much routine and boredom
•	Lack of communication
•	Insecurity and jealousy
•	Family and friends
•	Boundaries
•	neglect
There are more than these, but this all leads to a loss of attraction. If you think about that word "attraction," in a relationship, you do certain things that will make them more attracted to you. Of course, the opposite is true.
They take their sweet time trying to figure out what that issue is. They will ponder on it. Sometimes it may disappear. It can go away for a week, a month, or even several months, and then come back again. It comes back because there is something off that neither of you figured out.
Since we know they think about it sometimes, why are they still with you? Why are they choosing to stay and not bring it up? This is a common question and something men often talk about during calls. "Why didn’t she tell me?"
 
Breaking up and moving on is a serious thing. Normally, people don’t want to bring up something so negative with their partner. especially if they think it might be a fleeting feeling. Sometimes outside factors can influence your feelings. The stresses of life can do that.
 
There are potentially years of memories together, and they don’t want to just throw that away because they started feeling something for a day or two. However, as time goes on and that nagging feeling grows and festers, they eventually come to the conclusion that there is no other way.
 
They eventually understand that thinking of all the good times doesn’t change the fact that they feel this way right now. If they feel put off by you and they are thinking of all the good times, they will start thinking, "How did it get like this?" They will start feeling guilty for not wanting to be together anymore, which is again bringing more and more negativity into the relationship. It’s a harsh downward spiral.
 
One thing people forget is that your ex had a whole life before you. I have guys tell me on the phone all the time, "She never used to act like this man" or "I don’t even know who this person is." I feel bad for them, but the truth is that once someone loses attraction for you, that loving person isn’t there anymore.
 
Your ex will often spend time pretending that the issue isn’t even there, and they will continue putting out the effort to keep the relationship together. which is kind of cruel. However, I do understand it. Your partner doesn’t want to cause any more pain than necessary. If they find out that they regret their decision now, they seem inconsistent and childish. It’s almost like they test themselves to see if how they feel will continue.
 
They eventually come to the conclusion that keeping space and time apart is a good idea. This is why this is so common, and about half of my calls are about her saying she needs space and/or time apart.
Text messages, phone calls, and love are all slowing or ceasing to exist. They do want to talk to you, but they know it's not a good idea because it strings you along. Normal people don’t want to do this. They know if they continue to treat you like things are normal, they will hurt you more and more. They pull away more and more until you don’t hear much from them at all.
 
That coldness is what really bothers you. It’s so unexpected, too. Not long ago, they were kind, loving, and caring, and now they are ruthless. This can create some intense anger and resentment in you. I understand exactly how you feel. What I want you to understand is that they need to be cold. They must be. If they weren't, you would think there was something you could do or say to get them back.
I have seen men say and do some intense things to try to get their ex to listen to them and try to work things out. Some guys just don’t want to listen. This happens even when she’s cold!
 
So, imagine what warm behaviour would look like! especially for a woman. Her number one fear is a crazy man trying to hurt her. That is her greatest fear in life because most men are stronger and more powerful than her. If a woman is warm towards a man who she is leaving he is going to think there is some way to fix all this. She needs to be cold for you to get a clue that she means to stay away for a while.
They need that space to themselves WITHOUT YOU there to figure out what is wrong. She will literally be saying, "What the fuck is wrong with me?" You might be the perfect guy on paper, but she wants to leave you. Her family and friends might love you, but she still wants to leave. She will feel awful for feeling the way she does, but she does nonetheless.
 
Do not contact her family unless absolutely necessary by the way. Tons of guys have come to me for coaching, and they have been in contact with the family before they get to me. I see guys talk to the girl’s mother and sisters to try to figure out what’s wrong. DON’T! Just STOP IT. It won’t help you. Her family and friends aren’t going to convince her to stay with you if she (your ex) thinks it’s not a good idea. Her friends and family love her. They want her to be happy, regardless of your feelings.

What does time apart really mean?
 
At the time, time apart meant exactly that to your ex. She will think in that moment that time apart will help clear up any feelings she might have. Clear up the negativity. During the time apart, things can get stupid. She might start seeing someone else. She might be partying hard. She may literally be watching a movie with her mother.
 
Guys are so blown away by the way their ex is now behaving that they will say, "I don’t really know this person." In a sense, that's true. The version you saw was the one they wanted you to see. When the attraction fell, that care also fell. They no longer care what you think of them, really. So many exes will jump into a new relationship or go out partying. It happens all the time. They are now free, and they will express it without care. This is common and to be expected. Don’t take it personally. especially if you’re a man. Get back on your grind and mission.
 
Love follows attraction. You may think back to a time when they said and acted like you were the most important thing in their lives, and at that time it was true.
 
So, when they ask for time apart, a lot of people will say, "Oh, she wants to fuck around with some guy and not feel bad." That does happen, but during this ongoing feeling, she has been hit with a lot of negative thoughts. negative thoughts about herself, the relationship, or maybe just you. She wants to forget about all that for a while. Do I think it's mature behaviour? No, not really. But that's the reality. I see it happen all the time with the guys I coach. Their ex-partners are sometimes running around doing whatever they want. The point is that the more you try to get in their way, the more resentment they will feel towards you.
This happened to me and my ex. Every time I got dumped, they were seeing some new guy and partying hard. I tried to reason with them. I tried to get them to see the error of their ways by letting me go. They must come to that conclusion themselves, which is why self-growth is so important. More on that in a later chapter.
I will say it is hard to deal with. It's hard to watch your ex on social media living it up while you’re at home thinking of all the good times.

FAKE BREAKUPS
 
I just want to point something out quickly because this could be something you and your ex do.
Fake breakups are when one or both partners at some point use the idea of breaking up to manipulate the other person or a situation in their favour. This is something I did when I was in my first relationship. I used to threaten the idea of breaking up because I was so insecure about myself that I didn’t think I deserved love. Love flows freely from the other person when they want to show it.
 
I wanted love when I wanted it, so I would sometimes use manipulation tactics in order to get love from my first girlfriend. It was toxic as hell. I was clearly dealing with some issues. What happened was that she eventually said, "OK, let's call it quits."
 
We concluded that breaking up was just the right thing to do after each fight we had. She eventually cheated on me, but we had built up so much animosity towards each other that we would have broken up anyway.
 
The fake breakups will weaken the trust and bond you two have with each other. Manipulation is a heavy thing. The person doing it is trying to get something from the other person in the wrong way.
If you’re with a person who is like this, or if you were with a person who was like this, I would advise you to never look back, even if they come back.

The No Contact Rule
 
The no contact rule is just that: no contact. I want to say that now because people think that you can break certain rules here. No contact means you do not go out of your way to contact your ex! Generally speaking, this is going to be the case. There is an exception for kids. If you have children with your ex, then you must keep in contact with them; this is the secondary rule.
 
IF YOU MUST CONTACT YOUR EX FOR WHATEVER REASON, YOU MUST REMAIN COOL, CALM AND COLLECTED.
 
Sometimes you can’t help but contact them because you have kids or work together. The point is, you’re not confessing your undying love to her every time you see her. You remain warm toward them. not both hot and cold. not mean or angry. Do not show them that the breakup affects you so deeply. Your ex will be attracted to your strength, which is what we want.
 
During the breakup, you will not hear much from them like you did when you were together. However, they do know you didn’t want the breakup. So, this brings something I call "Dumpers confidence" This just means they are sure they can get you back.
 
What I like to tell my clients is that if you do no contact correctly and you start focusing on your goals, they will eventually wonder where you’ve gone. Their confidence will begin to fade when they realise you’re no longer waiting for them.
 
I say waiting for them because so many clients will actually wait. Even if I tell them not to, they hold on to hope. They are dreaming and hoping that their ex will just return tomorrow, and things will go back to normal. The sooner you face reality about your situation, the sooner your individual life will grow and get better.
 
There have been people I’ve coached for years who held onto hope for far too long, and they ALWAYS regretted it. They always wish they let go sooner.
 
We all fear what we don’t know or can’t control. We want your ex to be afraid of losing you instead of waiting and hoping. That is the end goal here.
For your ex to feel like they are going to lose something, you must first gain their respect back. Now, this will happen automatically if you give them space and start focusing on your own energy. Respect comes before love does. She must respect you, which means you have to respect her and what she wants right now.
 
Once that happens, they can begin to feel attraction toward you again. They can begin to feel like things will work out.
 
If you think about your relationship as a business deal, you and her are negotiating. They have decided to walk away from the negotiating table, so to speak. Well, you can’t really bargain with someone who doesn’t care what you have to offer. As a result, you must leave the table. Which means live your goddamn life.
 
The best thing I ever learned in life is that scarcity creates value. 
 
When you decide to be scarce and really work on yourself, you will be in the best position to get them back if you really want it by then. I have tons of coaching clients that get to the point where they don’t even want their ex back anymore. They just focus on their own growth. They will then ask me about how to make extra money online or how to grow their social pillar better.

The fading affect bias
 
This was a revelation to me when I first heard about it. I can’t actually remember where I heard this term, but the idea is that over time, people let go of or forget about their negative memories. Actually, it's more like the emotional intensity comes down. They don’t really forget about what you did or didn’t do; they just remember the positive memories more.
 
This also depends on the nature of what happened. If you get complacent or insecure in a relationship, it will be forgotten compared to physical abuse. So, if you’re in that kind of situation, it will take a long time for someone to forgive anything that made them feel incredibly unsafe. Especially women. Women (for the most part) enjoy feeling secure.
 
Let’s say 6 months went by and someone asked your ex how the relationship was. They aren’t going to bring up every single negative thing about you. They will most likely say something like, "It just didn’t work out." I’ve heard people say, "I just wanted him to get his act together, but it didn’t happen." even when I think back to my ex’s now. I’m not sitting here thinking they are terrible people, even though they cheated on me and left me.
 
I've simply let it go and am now preoccupied with other matters. The fading affect bias is your friend here because it will help you get your ex to consider coming back. I’ve helped plenty of guys get their ex’s back by revealing this to them. All they needed to do was stop the bleeding.
 
What I mean by that is that so many guys continue to message, beg, plead, and try to reason with their ex when all they need is time. As time progresses, they will slowly start remembering why they loved you. Now, this doesn’t automatically mean they are coming back when this happens. Again, I don’t want you to sit around hoping they will just come back. That is not a good place to spend your energy.
Your brain is going to tell you that fighting for the relationship is the right thing to do. fighting for her. This is what society has taught you. Your brain will tell you, "If you leave them alone, they will find someone else or they will forget about you." It's just not true.
 
It is true that they want space right now, but that does not mean that they will immediately forget about you.
What dumpees usually forget is that the more you are around, the more disrespectful it's going to appear.
The strongest negotiating position is to walk away and mean it, something I learned from coach Corey Wayne, and it is absolutely true. As I mentioned earlier, if you walk away from the negotiating table, the power shifts and changes.
Your ex just thinks that you're still at the negotiating table until they come back to revisit it, and what I've noticed is that a lot of dumpees want the power to choose.
 
I understand where you're coming from being in this position because they have hurt you, they dumped you, they left you, and you want to be able to return the favour because they left you at your most vulnerable.
 
This was absolutely necessary for your growth. I speak to a lot of men over the phone, and they always say, "Oh, if she had just told me, I would have made changes," which is not always true because people don't really change until they're forced to.
If they were the ones to leave, they must be the ones to come back and try again. Remember, they must think it's a good idea. If you respected their space properly and started working on yourself, when they do come back around, you're actually going to be different; you're going to be a better version of yourself.
Most of my clients who get their ex back have done no contact properly; they have given their ex space to breathe, and they have done a lot of self-work. I don't think I have personally seen somebody who is chasing, begging, and pleading actually get their ex back with respect and dignity.
You may get your ex back out of pity, but that's not what we are aiming for. Remember, they must respect you before they love you.

Does no contact work on men and women?
 
One of the most common questions I get when I coach both men and women is, "Will this work? Does this work on women? Does this work on men?
 
The answer is yes, of course it does; it doesn't really matter if you're a man or a woman; there are just some small intricacies that you have to apply.
 
For example, when it comes to women, they need to respect a man before they can love him. Women are attracted to strength and confidence, and when she realises that she has no power or control over you, she will soon start to respect you at the very least, and then from there, they can be attracted to you again.
 
As soon as you stay away long enough, she will begin to wonder what you've been doing, who you've been with, and what you've been working on, but in order for her to come back, she does need to reach that stage, and she can't reach that stage if you're chasing her.
 
There was a study done in 2010 called "He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not," and this went into detail about how women are more attracted to men whose feelings are unclear. I've seen many guys in the past profess their undying love over and over and over again, thinking that's exactly what their woman wants from him, and eventually she breaks up with him for some other bad boy. It's a classic tale. The guy is always wondering what the hell he did wrong. The more you show unreciprocated love and affection, she will lose your attraction and respect.
 
The sooner you step back and start focusing on your life, it will seem like you have an abundance mindset. A man who has options is someone she wants to be with, and this is where most men fail in the Reattraction process—understanding what women really want in a man.
In short, she wants a man who can be on his own and has options that focus on his purpose and mission. The guys that fail always make women and the relationship their purpose in life, and as soon as she realises that she wants to replace him with a stronger man, she does so. 
This is where the idea of the bad boy comes into play. Bad boys don't always pay attention or care that deeply about where their relationship is going at all times because that is her job.
I'm not saying that men can't focus on it ever but primarily it should be her focusing on how she feels about you where the relationship is going and you as a man or supposed to focus on your purpose, mission, direction getting goals accomplished.
 
Masculinity is at an all-time low. This means that men are now focusing more on relationships than on their purpose and mission.
 
Today, you see more women focusing on their mission and purpose than ever, and because this is happening, men have to be even more focused on their mission and purpose, more confident, and more focused.
 
No contact can work just fine, but you need to be focused. Don’t sit around doing anything during no contact. Make something happen.

What no contact is really about
 
One thing my students fail to realise at the beginning of coaching is that no contact is not specifically to get your ex back; most students actually think that it is, and they base every single action they take around that.
 
Some students, for example, will unintentionally run into their ex and think, "Oh no, I broke no contact."
 
The true purpose of no contact is for you to heal, refocus, and rethink your life up until this point.
 
Personally speaking, I've been able to build multiple businesses in the last five years that are going to sustain my life forever because of the decisions I've been able to make.
 
I'm not saying that to brag; I'm saying that every decision that you make is either propelling you forward or holding you back.
 
And one thing that we focused on in my coaching program is making better decisions, and in order to do that, you have to be aware of what you are doing and saying every day, sometimes every hour.
 
Some guys can't help but reach out to their ex. When they do, I will ask them, "What made you think that it was a great idea?"
They never have a good answer because, simply put, they don't know any better.
 
Becoming aware of the right decisions is key. I've heard somewhere before that 90% of healing is awareness. which I would have to agree with: if you are completely aware of the decisions, you're making every day and you're going towards a brighter future with those decisions, then you will heal the issues you have in your life.
 
To further reinforce this, let's say you are overweight and you decide it's not a good idea to be overweight because your body can't handle it anymore. Now that you are aware of why you need to lose weight, you need to decide and make the choice to lose weight and become healthier.
 
You are one decision away from a different life altogether, so you need to continuously make the right decisions more often than not.
 
And, most of the time, the right decision is the difficult one, and in this case, no contact is both the difficult decision and the necessary choice. Your relationship got here for a reason, and you need to figure out why.
 
Most of the time, when students come into my program, two areas we focus on are understanding women and attraction.
 
Now I coach mostly men, but it's the same way when I coach a woman. I talk about understanding men and what men's needs are, and then simply talk about the decisions we need to make to become the best partners we can be going forward, regardless of the outcome.
 
One major mistake I see is that people become outcome focused instead of process focused. They focus on the 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, 120-day, etc. no contact rule instead of focusing on making the right decisions day by day.
 
What are the right decisions? I will focus on this topic more in a later chapter, but the right decisions are going to be anything that reinforces your masculinity as a man. focusing on your mission and purpose. focusing on having a great physical body. focusing on your money. focusing on your social circle, like I mentioned before.
 
The hardest part of manage is not knowing when she's going to reach out, and again, that is an outcome focused perspective. Shifting your mindset to become process focused and goal oriented is the most important yet hardest thing to do during a breakup. Once you're able to shift this mindset, everything will become clear for you.

The five stages of no contact
 
Resistance and reasoning
 
The first stage of no contact is resistance. I call this the "great but pointless fight. Like I said before, once they have made this decision, there is no convincing them that it is the wrong decision; they must feel like it's the wrong decision through time and space.
 
This is where the begging, pleading, and reasoning come in. It's the initial shock of the breakup hitting you, and you're searching for answers.
 
You may even reach out to their friends and family during this time, which will only set you back. Remember, they have been thinking about this for several days, weeks, or even months, so reasoning gets you nowhere. They will see it as a sign of intrusion, clinginess, and neediness.
 
Another common thing is for you to constantly have conversations in your head about what you would say to them if you had the chance. It is very difficult to stop this, so I'm not going to tell you to stop it. What I tell my students to do is, when this is going through your head, break the pattern.
 
Remember what I said about choices? Breaking the pattern can be many different things, including going to the gym, going for a walk, or going out with friends.
 
I understand that you don't want to do anything while dealing with a breakup, but getting out of the house and doing something productive will again harness your masculine energy and get you focused on the right track. Like I said in the previous chapter, it's about shifting that mindset from relationship focused behaviour to goal focused behaviour.
 
One thing to keep in mind is that during this period of no contact, you should not beat yourself up for mistakes that you've made up until now. I have many students who pay me on a monthly basis, and many of them beat themselves up for months because they wish they knew this material better. I always tell them I understand, and it sucks but you're here to learn this lesson for a reason.
 
So, I'll say now that you are learning something. During this period of no contact, you are learning what did not work and what will not work going forward. It is up to you to figure out what the issue is and fix it.
 
Sometimes it's as simple as choosing a better woman. Sometimes the issue is communication (to be honest, that is one of the main reasons why many people break up). Regardless, you must figure out what it is and fix it, and like I said before, most people do not learn something unless they are forced to through pain.
 
Many guys are mad at themselves for not knowing, and this brings down their self-esteem and morale. Don't beat yourself up for something that you do not know now.
 
If you continue to make the same mistakes repeatedly, you have nobody but yourself to blame, but up until now, chances are you simply did not know better.
 
Society's conditioning is very powerful, and again, the only way to learn is to make mistakes to figure out what went wrong and why. which is exactly what leads me to my first point with every coaching session: figuring out what women want. what their nature is and how to maneuver around it.
 
It's not as difficult as it sounds; it's simply making the right decisions more often than not, like I said before.
 
The dumper enjoys the attention and having you as a safety net. During the no contact phase, you are breaking this expectation. which is extremely important.
 
This right here is exactly why chasing does not work; you are living up to the exact expectations that they already have. Breaking that expectation will make them reconsider leaving you forever.
 
Gaining perspective
 
Throughout the course of the relationship, the dumpee will begin to see the error of their ways. What it will sound like from my students is, "Oh man, I wish I knew this." "I wish that I knew that I was being complacent." You will eventually get to the point where you can read a woman’s body language towards you so well that you can tell when the attraction falls by even a sliver.
 
The truth is, you're never going to be able to keep attraction high all the time; it's impossible. You can't be perfect all the time. You just need to see when it starts to fall what those little signs are and correct them immediately. This is actually very easy to do when you're on your mission as a man and are goal focused instead of relationship focused. When you're goal focused and you see her pulling away from the relationship a little bit, you can correct it very easily.
 
Sometimes some of my students are actually on the complete opposite side of the spectrum because they are too busy and don't focus on the relationship at all. They end up neglecting their ex, making them feel like they don't matter. Getting them back is a completely different strategy altogether.
So, you must remain in the sweet spot, which is much closer to being mission focused than relationship focused.
 
For instance, when everything is going well, she will be completely up your ass. 
 
She will be calling you and texting you, wanting to be around you at all times. When the attraction begins to fade, she will slowly start pulling herself away from you, and this could be even smaller than you think. It might be something as small as the fact that normally she would be sitting very close to you during a movie night, and she decides to sit further away from you than normal. Something as small as that is sometimes a sign that guys will normally completely ignore.
 
When this happens, you have to go into diagnostic mode and think back to our last date.  Have I not been paying attention to her? Have I been too focused on my goals and purposes, etc. Then you can surprise her with some sort of date or something fun.
 
In the second stage of no contact, the anxiety and depression begin to lift and sometimes completely subside. This can take several days to several weeks; everybody is different.
 
I’m in constant contact with my clients, and they will often say something to me during this stage. They will often say, "You know, I'm OK without them" or "for so long, I have been focused on them and not myself."
During this stage, they still want them back, but they realise that they don't need them anymore.
During this stage, your ex will also begin to respect you again. You've been away for some time, and they've had some time to think about things. They will begin to think about the good times again during this stage since the emotional dial has been turned down. Remember earlier when I talked about the fading effect bias? The emotional intensity of the negativity in the relationship has come down quite a bit.
Sometimes during this stage, people will hear something from their ex. This is exactly why I coach the way that I do. I am able to guide my students through their breakup and give them advice as it's happening in real time. In this stage, you still want them back, and you can be completely surprised by a text or call from them, and you might become unhinged.
When this happens, I normally get guys to calm down, think rationally about the entire situation, and try to look at the bigger picture. Think about why she may be reaching out to you. In this stage, you're still hurting, but you're starting to get better. But because you're hurting and you still want the pain to go away, you might make a bad decision, like talking about the relationship.
 
Sometimes your ex has reached out to you because it's been so long since you two have spoken, and they want to know if they have any power over you. Remember, you want to stay calm, cool, and collected. If they do contact you during this stage, simply try to find out what they want. A lot of the time, they don't even really know why they're reaching out to you. You must stick to your mission and purpose, which is self growth and improvement right now. They are not at the point where they are ready to tell you that they want to get back together, and in my personal opinion, that's what they need to do.
It shouldn't be easy to get you back. You're a human, and you don't deserve to be tossed around like garbage, so make it difficult for them, even though it is very hard for you to do so.
Now, I'm not saying to be mean to them. You can be warm and easy to talk to, but remain stern and stick to your guns about what you want. Making their desires clear is usually what works for my students who get their ex back.
 
Usually, my students will say something along these lines.
 
"It's great to hear from you. I would love to see you, but I don't want to communicate unless we're going to be working on things between us. "Now I understand things need to go slow and steady, and we can't just pick up where we left off because there were obvious problems in the relationship, but I also don't want to be your friend."
 
This is the best way to handle it because you are telling them exactly what you want without sacrificing your dignity as a man. In my personal opinion, this is the most masculine way to handle this because, the truth is, if someone doesn't want you, you have one option. You walk away completely.
 
It is not masculine or strong to try to convince someone who does not want you to want you. The simplest answer is usually the right one. The more coaching that I do, the more I see that people do not want to lose options, especially women. This is another reason why they will continue to reach out to you, because they want to make sure that that option is still there in case any new options don't work out.
 
Confidence
 
In this stage, you were getting even further along the right path to getting yourself back, and as more and more time goes by, your ex is going to become even more unsure of how they feel about you, which in this case is a good thing after no contact. They need to think about you. They need to wonder about you. That is one of the most important rules of attraction when it comes to dating.
 
If they are too sure about you, how you feel, and where things are with you, there is no wonder or mystery. Since some time has passed, they are now wondering and starting to think twice. Funny enough, the more confident you get, the less you're going to care. Naturally, humans will return to a more natural state, which is why they say time heals all wounds. Being constantly anxious is something your body does not want to do.
 
It is during this stage that, a lot of the time, if they are dating somebody else, they will contact you a few times because they are beginning to be unsure about you and where they stand with you. They begin to think, "I might not be able to get this person back."
As you can see, as more time goes by, they lose confidence and you gain confidence. Think of it like a scale with two ends, one high and one low. A lot of the time, we place our ex on a pedestal, and we place ourselves below them.
 
which is where the saying "treat them like a celebrity and they will treat you like a fan" comes from. I still advise you not to date anybody for quite some time because it is much better to go into a relationship healed and thinking clearly.
 
This is a common mistake my clients will make. They will immediately get back on the horse without thinking about the other person that they are going out with. It is not fair to the new person or to yourself because you were not able to give fully and completely. I have seen this time and time again: just stay single until you are healed and clear.
 
On a positive note, the next relationship you will have if it is not with your ex will be much better because you're going to understand female nature better, relationships better, and yourself better.
 
Tons of my clients are with new women in new relationships, and they completely shifted their mindsets through this no contact phase. They became more goal focused instead of relationship-focused, and because of this, they are improving their lives and their confidence and self-worth, which attracts higher quality women. Too many people get into relationships because they're looking to fill a hole.
 
 
Re evaluation
 
The dumper realises it's been a long time since the dumpee has reached out to them, and they come to the conclusion that it's not going to happen.
 
This is where the dumper must face their decision; they have lost you. They feel uncomfortable thinking about you with other people, and this is where they will begin to reach out to you and start talking to you more often. In doing so, your behaviour has to be exactly the same. And it will be simple because you were actually getting stronger as the no-contact period progressed, especially if you had been doing the self-work.
 
start watching you and reaching out to you. They might even reach out to your family and friends if they can't get a hold of you. This is what happened to me personally. My ex reached out to my friends because she could not get a hold of me when I didn't want her back.
I was so busy living my life that I didn't recognise her phone number because I had deleted it. I ignored the texts initially and just deleted them and kept hanging out with my friends and continuing to live my life.
 
They will sometimes reach out on social media before texting you to see if you will respond. A lot of the time, your ex doesn't really want to face that rejection because they know it's possible. When they do look at your social media, they will see how well you are doing. This is not to be confused with faking it. A lot of guys I have spoken to thought it was a great idea to go hang out with a bunch of girls and take a bunch of pictures with them to make their exes jealous. If you do this too early, it will backfire. Remember what I said about destroying their trust, because they will believe you are doing it to make them jealous or angry at you in order to elicit a response.
 
Now, as time goes by, that doubt starts to creep into their mind organically because you have given them space and time to think about you properly, and then when they do see you with somebody else, it sinks in in a different way. Over time, they lose their confidence that they can get you back, and eventually they try to reach out to you to reconsider their decision.
 
At this point, some of my clients do not want their ex back. They had reached the point where they realised the pain wasn't worth it and wished to try it again with someone else. and that is totally OK.
The point of this book and why I'm even talking about it is that I want to help you reclaim your power so that you can choose whether or not to do so.
 
I want you to be informed about what the strongest negotiating position is and how to navigate your breakup and possible reconnection. Since you've been working on yourself so much, your ex will begin to wonder if your life is better without them.
This is where the dumper's true grief begins. This is where I've seen the most regret come from a dumper, as during this phase, because you have followed the rules, you have stopped chasing. Now your ex is completely unclear and clouded, like you were in the beginning.
Now, if you were to sit down and ask the dumper in this phase why they left you, it would be much harder for them to define a reason.
 
The fading affect bias has kicked in, and you've done the work on yourself. Now that your ex is confused, I'm wondering if they made the right decision. This leads into the next stage.
 
Possible reconciliation
 
Everything has completely turned in your favour and against your ex. This is where they reach out to you and want to see you. Earlier, I mentioned the two-sided scale where the dumper was much higher than the dumpee. Now it is much more balanced. The respect is restored, so the attraction can now go back up.
 
Since you've done so much work on yourself and your confidence has gone up, you might look at them through a completely different lens. You may realise they were not a good partner in the first place, and you can choose whether or not to return.
If you decide to reconcile, you have to take things very slowly. Do not rush back into things and just start dating again. Think of everything on a per date basis; don't start making plans for the future; don't get ahead of yourself; and have fun.

No contact while living together
 
This is exceptionally brutal because you see them on a regular basis and know what they're doing. You know when they come and go. You might even see them looking really good when they do leave, which is going to put certain thoughts into your head.
 
When you're living together, what you have to do is remain extremely focused. Regular no contact with people who aren't living together requires a specific amount of focus and when you are living together it requires even more focus.
 
Remember, you have to remain calm and warm to them until the living situation gets figured out, and when it comes to that, nine times out of ten, it's a good idea to have plans to move out.
Think about it the relationship got sour, and the attraction fell. One of the primary goals is to rebuild mystery and attraction.
 
Minimal contact is how you really want to approach it. Doing full no contact can actually make the entire thing very uncomfortable.
Think about it: You're going to come home and walk by her while she's sitting on the couch watching TV, and you're just going to say nothing?
 
This could go on for months. Eventually, you're going to speak to each other.
Simply maintain minimal contact as opposed to no contact.
 
The more relaxed and calm you remain while living together, the more put together you will appear. If you continue to have crazy emotional outbursts, it will only confirm why she broke up with you and why she needs to move out. Keeping the place clean and doing your part to help out will help you greatly down the road.
Just keep in mind that you're always trying to look as attractive as possible. Before you say anything, you want to ask yourself, "What is the most attractive thing I can say or do right now?" If you're not completely sure, you need to learn the fundamentals. Men who know the fundamentals are able to implement the right actions at the right times—to push and pull, so to speak.
 
To be quite honest with you, most of the time you're going to know deep down in your heart. The reason people ignore their gut reactions and instincts is because a lot of them are looking for comfort from their ex. It's like they want to get any kind of response or reaction from them because they've gotten pretty much nothing since they were together.
 
Start going out.
 
This is very crucial because if you're sitting around moping at home, there is no mystery to what you're doing. Your significant other should be wondering what you're doing and who you're out with, even if the attraction is low.
This goes along with the fact that you have to rebuild your life. Tons and tons of my clients have given up the most fun and intriguing parts of their lives, and it's time to go get that back. The number of students I've had who have said, "I'm finally going back to the gym; I finally lost all that weight; I'm starting to hang with my friends again; I'm finally starting that business that I've always wanted to start."
When you start living your life again, never give up your hobbies, interests, and friends because, for a woman, this is not masculine. It doesn't really matter where you are as long as you're not at the house.
 
What if they are bringing other people home?
 
This is why it's critical to make plans to move out because they'll want to live their lives. What I have told my students to do is make it very clear that you don't want to see other people coming into our shared home or shared place. If your ex doesn't really give a sh*t about what you think, then you need to move out as fast as you can because they clearly don't respect you enough.
 
Truthfully, there isn't a whole lot you can do. Here is what you can control. your own actions!
 
If you’re paying the bills or own the house or apartment,
 
If you own the apartment or house and/or you're paying all the bills and they are bringing people back home, you 100% reserve the right to kick them out. If they continue to bring people back home and you have voiced that you do not want this and you're paying all the bills, kick them out.
Tell them to stay at a friend’s house or a family member's house until you guys can reach some sort of agreement on when they're going to come and get their stuff.
 
I would absolutely not tolerate any kind of behaviour like that if I was paying for all the bills or owned the house.
Now if you own the house and are paying all the bills and they're not bringing people back home and they have nowhere to go, obviously you don't want to kick them to the curb, which I understand. This is just the reality of what happens post breakup.
 
Tons of people break up and end up living together for quite some time until they make arrangements to move out. Just make sure you are absolutely clear about the rules if you are paying for the place yourself.
 
If you both went 50/50 on bills or are currently going 50/50 on bills and they do continue to bring people home, then just move out yourself.

No contact Rule with kids
 
This is probably one of the most common questions I get in the comment section of a YouTube channel, in emails, direct messages, and during coaching calls.
 
This is a tough one to navigate because you have to remain in contact with your ex in order to make plans for the kids. You likely have to pick them up from school; maybe you share custody with your kids.
 
Whatever the case is, you have to remain in contact, so there are a few rules. the first rule is that you have to remain warm and calm as often as you can. I understand this is difficult because you are going through a breakup. The family might be coming apart, and you're worried that you won't be able to get your family back. Try as hard as you can to remain warm, calm, collected, and cool.
 
The more emotional you are, the more control they have over you. Don't get me wrong, I understand it's very difficult to face the idea of losing your family. However, if you want any kind of shot at making things work, there is a certain way to do it, and being emotional is not that way.
Now, if you slip up a couple of times, it's not really a big deal. It's the consistency of your actions that is going to reveal your strength during this time.
 
The second rule is that when you're talking to your ex directly, maybe through text or over the phone, make sure it is short, sweet, and to the point, almost like a business transaction. This will prevent you from acting on your emotions, which are trying to tell you that you can convince her to work on things. You will use the idea of family to get them to think twice about leaving.
 
I have seen so many guys do that over the course of my coaching. They try to use logic and reason together to change her mind, and, in this case, men will often use the idea of family to try to keep the relationship together.
Make sure you prioritize yourself because it is going to be harder for you to get over your ex when you see them constantly and they are constantly showing up in your life. When you see someone all the time, it's difficult to get closure.
 
when you focus on improving yourself and working through your issues. Your attraction will continue to go up, making you attractive to new women and, of course, your ex, whom you are going to constantly see.
 
So, as you can see, the theme of this book is constant self improvement. Every time you are faced with a decision that involves someone else that you cannot control, the default action is to work on yourself.
 
Don't fall into the trap of living in fantasyland just because you have a kid with this woman. Tons of guys will delude themselves into thinking, "Oh, someday we'll get back together because we have a kid." Remember, your ex must have an emotional reason to come back to you. What is their reason, and why should they come back to you?
Like I mentioned above, complacency and insecurity are the two main reasons that I see women leave men. if you are still choosing to take the wrong actions. Should she come back to you? I ask this to the guys in my coaching program all the time, who often wonder when she is going to reach out.
 
What makes things even more difficult is how your kids are dealing with the whole thing.
Dealing with no contact and kids just adds another level of pressure to the breakup. It also adds a level of uncertainty because you are going to be in constant contact with your ex, and sometimes they may be warm and sometimes they may be cold.
 
I deal with this a lot because a lot of guys will wonder why she is so cold all of a sudden when she was just so warm last week. The answer to that question is that sometimes people are still dealing with the fallout of the breakup. The emotions are still heavy. You also must remember that people are still individuals dealing with their individual problems.
 
It's very easy to get caught up in your own emotions because you are hurt. They might have broken up with you or ended their relationship, so it's very easy to get caught up in how you are feeling and what matters to you. A lot of guys will forget that their ex still has feelings and might be going through something.
 
When dealing with no contact, remain calm, focused, and warm as often as you can while focusing on your goals, mission, and purpose. The real difference is how frequently you will communicate with your ex versus someone who does not have children.
Always keep this one thing in mind as well as your default action, regardless of what your ex has said or done in the past couple of days, weeks, or months: work on yourself. I know it sounds cheesy, but there is no other way. There are going to be areas in your life where you are not where you want to be. Work on those areas. That is the one thing that you can control during the no contact period.

Working with your ex
 
Most of the time, you are going to want to stick to no contact to deal with your breakup, but there are times when there are other ways to go about the breakup.
The first exception to this is if you work with your ex. I have had many coaching sessions over the years with guys who are still working closely with their ex. They will frequently inquire about the best way to handle the situation and interact with them while attempting to reclaim them. I will say that seeing your ex on a daily basis while going through a breakup is extremely difficult because your brain and their brain are both going through different experiences right now.
 
It's impossible to just ignore each other, especially if you work in the same department and have to interact with each other. People will begin to notice, including your bosses and maybe department heads. What you must do is remain completely professional and treat your ex as a co-worker, and that's it. Again, this will be very difficult because you have many memories and emotions going on right now, but this is the right path to take. Sometimes students will challenge me and ask me why this would be the right thing to do. So, what I like to do is come up with a couple of scenarios and ask what you think the best course of action would be.
 
We know why you can't remain friends at this point because that is not what you want. We know chasing and pursuing doesn't do anything. Our goal is to remain warm and confident as often as possible while trying to show you are not bothered by the breakup. Remember, they want to know that they have some power or sway over your emotions.
When you show up to work and you're acting completely professional, unbothered, and even confident, it will get them to think twice about why you're acting so cool. This is especially important if you have already begged and pleaded at some point. They will wonder why you made a sudden 180-degree turn.
 
Keep it strictly business related as often as possible without expressing your emotions or telling them how much you miss them. They know how much you love them and how much you miss them.
One thing I notice that happens during breakups is that it makes the workplace extremely awkward because people don't know who needs to give up certain things. For example, there may be office or work friends that you both share; who's going to be the person that hangs out with them during lunches from now on?
 
Sometimes, workplaces have certain kinds of groups within their culture. like, for instance, a football group or maybe just a general sports group. A lot of the time, if you guys share any of these groups together, someone's going to be upset about having to give it up or share post breakup.
 
Now I can't possibly get into every kind of workplace scenario because there are just so many that can happen. My advice to you is that anytime you interact with your ex in any situation, you have to remain calm. You want her to think, "Wow, he seemed so composed and put together."
Anytime you present yourself to the world, that's what your aim should be. It's easy to do when you actually do feel that way on the inside. Always remain civil and respectful towards them, especially at work.
That's just one example. You guys may share certain things at the office, and now it becomes difficult to exist at the workplace. constantly thinking, "What if I run into them, what should I say?"
Having them at work can actually be a positive for you if you really think about it. the reason behind this is that they can see your changes. Say you need to lose weight, for example. She will see that you are losing weight and starting to build some muscle. She will see how you carry yourself. You might even start dressing differently because you're losing weight.
 
The workplace is a great place because you can almost guarantee that they're going to see you and be there. The problem comes from having a lot of hope and just wishing things would be different. One thing I hear from a lot of coaching clients is, "If only I could just talk to her," thinking that that's somehow going to change her mind.
 
Use the opportunity of her being able to see you on a daily basis to show off your physical appearance and changes. She may even compliment you. If she does, just smile and say thank you.

What happens if I run into my ex?
 
Before I begin this part, I just want to make sure that you're not purposely going to the same place that your ex loves to go, hoping to "bump" into them so that you can strike up a conversation.
 
I have had students in the past do this and then message me saying, "Hey, I bumped into them," and a lot of the time it turns out to be horrible. The dumpee is looking for some reassurance and kindness from their ex when normally there is just coldness and uncertainty.
 
So, you start with no contact, and everything is going extremely smoothly. You might even be proud of yourself for sticking to a no contact regimen for 60 or 90 days. Then your ex appears out of nowhere. Your stomach just dropped through your asshole, and now you're staying in there, going, "What the fuck do I do now?"
 
If you can't completely avoid the entire situation and you're about to walk by each other, simply make eye contact and say hi. I want to keep your tone in the right place here as well. If your tone is too happy, it will come off like you're a little too excited. If it comes across as too low and dull, think, "Oh, he's sad." Just keep it as casual as possible.
 
It's very possible that a short conversation could happen between you. Again, we're going along with the theme of calm and relaxed and asking her how she's been doing. I wouldn't stay more than a minute. You want to come off of this; you’re about to go somewhere important.
 
If it's gone past a minute, just say, "Hey, I've got to get going." I hope you have a great day. Stick with the main theme of calm, collected, and cool. When you finally get away from her, you're going to have a "WTF just happened?" moment. You'll be very proud of yourself if you stayed calm. the students that have had this happen to them and were able to remain calm, like I said, will eventually realize that they can keep their emotions under control when their ex is around.
 
The disconnect happens when guys lose their shit at the beginning of the breakup because a lot of them beg and plead. Then you run into your ex out of nowhere, and the last time you saw her was when you were crying, begging, and pleading.
So, this insecurity will bubble up inside them, making them wonder, "Will I be OK if I see my ex again because the last time wasn't so great?"
So, when they end up seeing their ex on the street or maybe at a party and they keep themselves under control, they gain this new sense of power and self-respect.
 
There is a possibility she might message you, saying, "It was good to see you. "I hope you're doing well."
 
This can be an extremely confusing message because you'll be wondering what to say and how to say it. You'll also be wondering what she wants and why she is messaging you now.
Seeing you is going to bring back memories for her too, and not all of them are going to be bad. So, she might reach out to you and say hi to see how you're doing. How you respond here is going to be paramount to your success.
 
You want to respond that you've been working on yourself in a general manner. bring up things like the gym and work-related things. I would stay away from getting too detailed about what you've been working on.
For example, someone will say, "Oh, I've been working on my "communication issues," knowing that's a reason why the breakup happened or partially happened.
If you get too detailed, she will think that you're doing it for her and not for yourself. Remain pretty general about what you tell her you've been doing.
 
Then inquire about herself and her activities. I would stay away from asking her if she's dating someone, as that's a pretty awkward thing to ask. You may even feel like you have a right to know, but to be brutally honest, the second that they broke up with you, that right went out the window.
Unless they blatantly volunteer that they have been dating, just leave it out of the conversation.
 
Don't stay on the phone too long and go about your day. At the end of the conversation, she is going to be thinking to herself that you seemed very composed and relaxed.
 
If you run into them at the grocery store, or maybe even a coffee shop, or anything like that, it's the same advice, but you want to apply different behaviours depending on the situation.
One example is running into your ex at a party. This happens all the time because there are often plans for specific birthdays or weddings to which you are both invited. At a party, you're there to have fun and have a good time.
 
You don't want your ex catching you acting sad at a party; it's just awkward because everyone there is going to know why you are so upset. It's super awkward to know that everyone there who's talking to you knows how upset you are about your breakup.
 
Let's say you are both invited to the same wedding. I would advise going only if you are close friends with them and, of course, with family members. Let's say some of her friends or family invite you to their wedding before you guys break up; you probably shouldn't go just to keep things civil and less awkward.
 
I think about how awkward it would be if she was the only person that you knew at a social event or wedding. She would feel obligated to come and talk to you because she knows that you don't know everybody there. It's better to go when both of you know many people at that event. If you both share the same friends and you were both invited, then you can go, but of course remain civil and cool.

What if my ex is dating other people?
 
If you're absolutely sure that your ex is dating somebody else, the first thing you should know is that there is absolutely nothing you can do about it.
 
I have a rule in my coaching with my monthly clients: The rule is this:
 
Can you control the outcome of the thing that you're worried about?
 
The reason why I bring this up is because many clients will ask what to do about a specific situation, but they literally can't control anything that's happening. You can't tell your ex who she should date.
So, think about what you can control and execute on that. Can you control who your ex decides to date? No. So what can you control in this situation? how you act about it. And again, going back to the main theme of the book, being calm, cool, and collected is what you're aiming for. 99% of the time, if they're already dating somebody else, it's a rebound relationship, which will be in the next chapter.
 
Finding out that they're dating somebody else is a real punch to the gut, but it's also not the worst thing in the world because it's most likely not going to last. Rebound relationships tend not to last very long.
Still, I know how much it hurts to find out that your ex is with somebody else and not you. It can make you feel extremely unworthy and unloved, and you will begin to be jealous, and you'll start asking yourself, "What does he have that I don't have?"
 
Remaining cool and relaxed, as difficult as it may be, is the only way that you can act. You do not want to act bothered by the fact that she's dating somebody else in front of her. Behind closed doors, you can breakdown and cry if you need to, but channel all of your energy and emotions into things that you can control.
Pour all of your energy into yourself. your goals, your dreams I get things accomplished. You will never regret working on yourself, but you will regret sitting around being upset over a girl and a situation that you could not control.
 
The question I will pose to you is: Should you really want somebody back in your life who decided to discard you and date somebody else?
 
Let's say they come back and contact you while dating somebody else, or they might be on the way out of that relationship. They were literally just with another person. Do you really think you're going to be able to get over that if your ex comes back and wants to work things out with you? I have personally been through this.
 
I can tell you from personal experience that you don't simply forget that your ex was with someone else. 
 
As much as you want to forget it, there will be moments when you're sitting there thinking about what they could have been doing together. They are, after all, two adults, so they were most likely sexual. Does that sit comfortably with you?
 
To me, it doesn't. I was not comfortable with the fact that she was dating somebody else, and I would never be comfortable with the fact that she discarded me and started dating somebody else and tried to come back.
 
I would not be comfortable with any kind of chance that my ex was with somebody else sexually while we were once together. Most of the men I coach are not really comfortable with this either. To me, it's just sloppy seconds, and I don't want anybody to be sloppy seconds, do you?
It is completely up to you, and of course you can make your own decisions. What I will say is that there are many wonderful women in the world. There are also a lot of bad women. If it were me, I would continue to circulate until I met a great woman instead of going back to my ex.

What if my ex is acting toxic?
 
I've seen a lot of situations where a guy is coming off of a breakup and his ex-girlfriend is talking shit about him either on social media or to his friends and family.
 
Sometimes your ex can act extremely immature, almost like their behaviour is unrecognizable. It's even more difficult when you find out that they're talking shit about you.
 
The best way to deal with your ex yelling at you is to keep your cool and avoid engaging in the same behaviour they are. I've seen many men just act the same way their ex is acting by talking shit as well.
the only people who are going to really agree with her are her family and friends. Strangers will see it as a classless act, especially people on social media. Everybody sort of knows not to air dirty laundry online.
 
They're just showing you who they really were the entire time. People can hide who they are pretty well. Do you really want somebody like that back in your life? Maybe you're dodging a bullet here.
 
You want to stay away from people who are going to be toxic in your life. When you invite people into your life and they do not treat you with respect, kindness, and dignity, no matter if it's a breakup or not, you should discard them from your life and never speak to them again.
 
Toxic energy is very sticky, and it's very easy to get caught up in it. Think about the last time that you were gossiping about somebody. It's very easy to get caught up in the conversation.
 
With all the years that I've been alive and all the situations that I've seen and heard over the years, I've noticed that there are a lot of toxic people in this world.
 
Most of the time, toxic people are just projecting how they feel about themselves. So, if you find that your ex is talking shit about you or doing something toxic that involves you, the problem is not really with you; it is with them.
 
The most important lesson here is to not engage in their behaviour, because if you do, they know that they have power over you. They will remember that all they have to do is get toxic for you to react.
I know it might feel good to throw some of that toxic behaviour back in their faces, but I promise you it doesn't actually do anything. the best way to handle toxic behaviour and bad energy is to just remove yourself from it.
 
You're only going to be holding yourself down and holding yourself back if you participate in negativity. So, what I'm really saying is to take the high road and again focus on your own energy. You never want people to think that they can ever control you.
 
Think about it like this: Anybody that can get you to be emotional controls you, and the last thing in the world that you want is for your ex to control you.
 
 
There is a saying that I have always lived by which is "don't bleed on somebody who did not cut you". sometimes us humans and this could be your ex, carry around a lot of baggage.
People who have had traumatic experiences happen to them are sometimes acting out how they feel about that specific experience on you.
 
Hot and cold behaviour—why do they do this?
Sometimes, after a breakup, you will still be in contact with your ex, especially if you have children or another logical reason to keep talking to them. It's common for them to act hot and cold.
 
Hot and cold behaviour is extremely aggravating. One moment, everything is cool, hot, and heavy; it might even seem like you guys might get back together, and then, out of nowhere, she disappears on you. She just treats you like garbage when she is talking to you.
 
There are tons of possibilities for the reasons behind this, but what you have to know off the bat is that you can't assume things are going to go a certain way when dealing with a breakup.
 
Until you hear from your ex that they want to work things out, stay as present moment focused as you can. The dumper is experiencing a range of emotions, just not as intensely as you are.
Truthfully, there are moments when they are going to want to come back to you, but they do know deep down inside that they have to be sure because if they are not, they understand that they are going to be hurting you. So, when this happens, don't chase them, don't call them, don't text them; just let them be and let them come to you.
 
it is very easy to let the anxious part of you take over and want to soothe that pain and get them back into your life. I totally understand this, because their contacting you in any way seems like a goal that has now been reached.
 
If they are constantly hot and cold with you, don't reward the behaviour with more contact from you; simply back off and continue working on yourself like normal.
Pulling back and focusing on your energy is going to do a few things for you. First off, it's going to make it seem like you are strong and not needy in the relationship.
 
Secondly, it's going to seem like you have your shit together. which is an attractive thing. Thirdly, it's going to seem like you are respecting their boundaries and space. Yes, they did contact you, which is confusing, but all this confusing behaviour is exactly why emotions cloud judgment so often. Emotions will pull you one way and push you another way, and women are emotional creatures by design.
 
This does not mean men cannot be emotional; women have emotional operating systems, which means if they don't feel like doing something they won't do it, and if they feel like doing it they will. 
What men are better at is stepping back from the emotional side of the conversation and looking at things logically from a 30,000-foot view. I've seen a lot of men act emotionally on a consistent basis, and I've seen women act very masculine-centred and calm. This all comes back to how you were raised and what issues you're currently dealing with. I'll talk about this more later in the book.
If they keep contacting you and acting hot and cold, start withdrawing your energy. Keep things short and sweet with them without being cold.
 
if you jump to anger, you're just showing them that they can control you still. Remain warm, calm, and collected like normal, and show them they do not control you.
 
Eventually, they will realize they can't control you, which will push them further along the stages of no contact. Attraction can rise, and they might constantly contact you from here on out. What you don't want to do is let them take advantage of you, which is why you need to know exactly what you want.
 
I said earlier in the book that you need to be aware of what you want and strict about what you do want. Again, many of my students will say they want the relationship to continue, but they do understand that there are issues in the relationship that do need to be worked on. When you say that you recognize there were issues in the relationship from both ends, it communicates that you understand them.
 
It will communicate that you understand their needs and why they broke up with you.
If you're able to do this properly, you're going to show them that you're not going to tolerate negative behaviour over and over again. You're only going to communicate with her and talk to her if she's going to be nice and kind to you.
This is something I have personally been through. One of my ex-girlfriends wanted to keep in contact with me, but she was also dating another guy, which is why she was hot and cold with me. I told her I wanted to get back together, but I also said that I would not tolerate her coming and going as she pleased, thinking she could toy with me. 
This showed her that I was willing to stand up to her, which again shows that you respect yourself. She cannot respect you if you do not respect yourself. This is ultimately why she wanted to come back to me, because I was beginning to move on. I was beginning to respect and love myself enough to move on with my life.

Hot and cold meetups
 
OK, let's say, for example, that you and your ex are meeting up and things are going slowly towards a relationship, and then they back off. A lot of hot and cold behaviour happens in this situation.
 
If you meet up with them and things are good, you end up sleeping together, maybe go on a good date, and then they disappear. Sometimes that happens because they are overwhelmed by seeing you.
 
They got overwhelmed by all the memories and feelings, and sometimes your attitude and demeanour as well, because you've changed so much.
 
All you need to do in this situation is just keep doing what you've been doing; they're the ones that are confused. They don't know what to make of you, think of you, or feel about you, so they usually back off to gather their thoughts and feelings.
 
If you try to set a date to see them and they don't respond for awhile, just leave them alone and let them come to you.
 
The best rule of thumb here is to let them come to you. If they broke up with you, they don't want to see you; they need to come to you. 
 
Remember, this is a balance of power. They have the power because they left you, and no contact and time apart will help rebalance and reshift that power.
 
Making yourself scarce when they act funny is an act of self love and self respect. Let's be honest, you want a relationship. You want to take things seriously, and they are coming and going as they please, acting hot and cold. 
 
Don't reward this kind of behaviour again Be warm, but your attention and time are the best resources you can give them if they're acting right. Time is something we cannot get back. Don't let them waste your time and energy.

Friends with benefits
 
A large portion of my students will get this offer from their ex to continue sleeping together but not in a relationship.
 
They don't want to commit anything to you, but they want to be able to get regular sex and free attention. Men, you have to understand one thing about women and what makes them tick. Women love attention. That is their currency, and most of the time, men just give away their attention like it means nothing.
 
This is why purposeless, unfocused men never get high quality women. They just give away their attention because their actions show that their attention means nothing.
 
Don't be friends with benefits if you don't truly want that. I understand you must be thinking, "Oh, at least this is something," and the more I sleep with her and hang out with her, the closer we will get to reconciliation.
 
This is false because you are acting out of pocket. What you truly want is a relationship with this specific person. Remember the negotiating table analogy? You only get what you negotiate for in life. If she is negotiating friends with benefits with you and you want a relationship, the deal will not work, and you must remove yourself from the table.
 
It's a balance of power, and if you accept something that you do not want, which is, of course, a friend with benefits, then she has won. the point of all this is to never accept anything in life that you do not want.
 
You will only get what you negotiate from people.
 
let's say you started friends with benefits already and you regret it, and you want to go back. What you must do is stop seeing them this way and tell them this is no longer something I am interested in doing.
 
This is quite common because men still think that having regular sex with your ex is going to lead to reconciliation.
 
Pull your attention back and make it known exactly what you want. Nine times out of ten, they will not accept these terms and will back off as well.
 
You must continue your growth as an individual and make room for new women in your life. Eventually, one of two things will happen. She will either return and try to work things out with you, or she will never contact you again.
 
This is what it means to have direct honesty with yourself and your intentions for what you want in this life. This life is exactly what you make of it. Every thought matters. Thoughts turn into actions, and actions breed the results that you want in this life.
 
If you have no idea what you even want, the outside world will continue to be what it is, and sometimes that will disappoint you. Be very clear about what you want with this life and the people you interact with, and that will either be reciprocated or not.
 
This is one of the deepest and strongest lessons I have ever learned in life. Other people want to decide what's best for you, even though you have the gift of free will. With that gift, most people don't even use it. They want others to tell them what to do. 
Friends with benefits It's just not congruent with what you want, plain and simple.

Getting your ex off that pedestal
 
It is very common for people to put their ex-partners on this massive pedestal after a breakup. Rejection breeds obsession. Anytime you get rejected, you're going to obsess over the person who rejected you. This is especially true for this person, with whom you spent a lot of time with. If you want to get your ex back or make it with any woman going forward, you cannot place her above you in terms of value.
 
Rejection is a nasty thing. It will make you doubt yourself and find out who you really are as a person. it will make you question everything up until now and make you believe you're not good enough.
 
This is why so many of my students and the people I coach so badly want to get their ex back just to reject them; they want to make their ex feel like they feel right now. They want them to feel that rejection.
 
When you do this, women often know when you're doing it, and they will treat you that way. Treat them like a celebrity and get treated like a fan.
 
I often hear, "This is the best woman that I've ever been with." "I will never find somebody like her." "We had such great times together, and I'll never be able to replicate that."
 
Deep down inside, you know that this isn't true, but it is what you feel right now. When my students say this to me, I will often ask them about their previous exes. And they usually dismiss it as insignificant, but you had feelings for that ex at one point.

Only thinking about the good times will burn you.
 
I see this time and time again. Dumpees will only remember the good times after the breakup. They will think that their ex is the only person who could ever make them happy again. This is your brain playing a trick on you. Because, again, rejection breeds obsession, and because you want your ex back so badly, your brain is going to filter out all of the negative and bad times automatically while your emotions are so high.
 
the truth is, if you sit down and really think about it, there is a lot about your ex that you might not really like. When things were going well in the relationship, their flaws were going to be more obvious to you.
 
So, what I really want you to do is write down some of the things you disliked about your ex.
This is something that will bring your ex down from the pedestal that you put them on.
 
A cool concept is the idea that perception is reality. There are other people in this world that think your ex is just a regular, normal person. You add so much value to them because you love them and are attached to them.
 
This is because your perception of them is inflated, and if you think about it long enough, you will realize they are truly not that special.
 
I'm sure your ex has done some dumb shit through the course of your relationship.
This is one of the fundamental parts of letting go. It's really revealing how our own perception can change because of how we feel.
 
I have had many clients over the years tell me that they had no idea why they were so obsessed with their ex. They will give me a laundry list of things that they don't even like about them.
 
As the emotional intensity comes down, you will begin to think clearly, just as your ex is going to do with you, and that's where the rebalancing of power will come in.
 
Why you should never accept friendship
 
Women will often offer you friendship post-breakup, and I can see why it seems like a good idea at the time.
 
First, let's look at why they want to be friends. First off, it's easy for them to be friends with you because they can easily just call you up and come back. Think of it like a demotion. She can easily promote you back to boyfriend status whenever she wants to if you stay friends.
 
Second, she does not want to lose options. Why would anybody want to lose an option? Sometimes women will put you in the friend zone because they have another option they are exploring. They want you there as a safety net. They know you and are comfortable with you, so they put you in the orbiter position.
 
Women have a lot more access and variety than men do. Even average women on dating apps will get messages from men wanting to hook up.
 
You should never accept friendship because, like I said earlier, it's something you do not want. A lot of people accept it because they think that it will again lead them to a place of reconciliation down the road. Dumpers will say to themselves, "At least it's something."
 
This is not fair to you because you want to continue their relationship and work on things, and they want to demote you to friendship. If you have self-respect and self-love, you will not accept friendship because it is truly not what you want.
 
I understand that it's hard because you want any kind of interaction with your ex; you want to be able to text them or call them in any kind of manner. Remember what I said earlier: sometimes the right decision is the hardest decision, but in the end, it's better for you.
 
I have seen men accept friendship only to regret it down the road. They had hopes in their minds that it would lead them to a date, which would then lead to the bedroom and then reconciliation.
 
the best negotiating position is to walk away with your head held high, practising self-love and self-respect. Never, ever accept friendship. Even if you refuse friendship, they will respect you for standing up for yourself and going after what you want.

What to do when you're back in contact with your ex.
This is what you've been waiting for. No matter how much time has gone by, there is nothing more surprising than that text or call from your ex. Most of the time, my clients who are in my program have no idea what to do when this happens. Truthfully speaking, there is a small window of opportunity that most relationships will have, but since they don't know the fundamentals, that window of opportunity will slip by.
 
90% of the time, they will reach out to you when you least expect it. You'll be at the gym or hanging out with friends, doing completely normal things. You look down at your phone, and you see that text.
Most of the time, it catches all my clients off guard, and they will often ask, "What do I say?"
 
From your perspective, from the inception of your breakup until now, you have experienced a range of emotions, and some days have been hard and some days have been easier. Your ex has been a constant in your thoughts. It's been a difficult time for you, to say the least.
From the dumpers' perspective, they mostly got what they wanted. At the end of the relationship, they realized they needed space. They got their space. They got the time alone that they needed. They got the independence that they needed.
 
Most of the time, after a breakup, people go out and have a lot of fun. They begin to spice up their looks, and they are much more open to social gatherings and parties. This completely distracts them from thinking about you and the relationship, while all you can do is think about them.
Eventually they get to a point where they will say, "Was all this worth it? There's only so much partying you can do. Social gatherings eventually get old. They can only distract themselves for so long.
They get to the point where they begin to think about you. What you've been up to and what you've been working on, especially if you've been sticking to no contact, The entire time that you've been suffering, they've been basically having fun.
 
A large amount of their time is going to be spent alone. Once they have exercised all of their fun options and they get tired of always being alone, that's when they hit you up.
It's very possible that a lot of their "happiness" is rather fake. Yeah, they may like their newfound independence, and of course we know that they are relieved, but they're not really happy. It will seem like they are, but deep down, they're not really that happy. Unless, of course, they are coming out of a toxic relationship with you, but I'm going to assume that's not the case.
 
They will even post on social media, making it look like they're happier than they really are. It all happens at once. They get their hair done, their nails done, new clothes, etc. Those things make you happy for a moment, but it doesn't last.
 
When they are alone long enough, they will begin to think about you and the good times they had with you. Given their experiences with you, they find it much more difficult to enter into a new relationship than you might think.
 
Jumping into a new relationship is a lot harder for them than you might think. Yes, they may be getting a lot of attention because of dating apps, but the last person that they felt a true, deep connection with was you.
 
They will think to themselves, "haven't heard from him in a while," becoming more and more uncertain about how she feels about you. The irony is that you've been working so hard on yourself, and it's beginning to show. It is during this part that they will start to see you on social media, living your life. 
 
They'll do this for a week or two before even reaching out to you, and it's sometimes longer than that.
They realize they're not much happier than they were when they left you because they see you happy as a result of all your hard work on yourself over the last few weeks/months.
 
They're pretty much in the same spot that they were. This is where the insecurity sets in, because they realize you don't need them anymore. Remember that they have been confident (what I call dumper confidence) that they can get you back at any time.
When they realize you don't need them anymore, this is when the reality of the breakup really begins to hit them. The tables have turned because they're the ones looking you up and wondering what you're up to, possibly stalking your social media accounts, and here you are living your best life. This is the true power of self-work and no contact. People get in their own way when beginning and maintaining no contact because they truly don't believe in the process. I truly understand why. It's scary, but like I said before, you can never go wrong with working on yourself.
You can never go wrong by standing up for yourself and letting go of somebody who does not want you. This is exactly what you've always wanted since the beginning of the breakup. The negative memories that they have of you, and the emotional attachment and weight attached to those memories, have faded. (The fading affect bias)
 
Since you've been so silent, all of the insecure thoughts are going to start hitting their brain. They will begin to wonder if you are dating somebody else or if you even still care at all. They’ll want to know why you don't care anymore and why you haven't reached out to them.
In this exact mindset is where the respect has been regained in her mind. Remember, respect comes before love with women.

The indirect or direct approach from your EX
 
This is one of the general messages you received from your ex.
"Hey, how are you?"
"Hey, it's been a while. "How have you been?"
"What's new with you?"
"Hey"
"Hey, I'm not sure if you want to hear from me or not, but I wanted to see what you're up to and how you've been."
 
The messages are going to look something like that. They might vary a little bit, but there are two types of approaches from your ex that are most likely to happen. What I just showed you is the more direct approach, where they are showing a little bit of interest and talking to you.
 
The other type of approach you will see is the indirect/direct approach. It's called indirect/direct because they are directly contacting you but are being indirect about why they are contacting you, and it's extremely confusing because it won't make any sense when they tell you why they're contacting you.
 
Here's an example.
"Hey, I know it's been a while since we spoke, but I just want you to know I still care about you."
A message like this is extremely confusing because they're not being direct about why they are contacting you, besides the fact that they want you to know that they still care. However, this is how they hook you because a normal response from a dumpy is usually going to look like "I really care about you too; I hope we can work things out," and the dumper "will go woah woah woah; it's not like I want to get back together."
Now you're sitting there holding your phone, going, "What the fuck did I just do?"
There are many different variations on how this will look, but the point is, you want them to say very directly why they are contacting you. You want them to say something.
•	"I would love to see you."
•	"I would love to work things out."
•	"When can I see you?"
•	"Are you available anytime soon?"
Now they're not going to come straight out and say this because they are going to be afraid of rejection, so it's going to take a little bit of back and forth from you. So when they do message, don't sit on the phone for too long, giving them too much validation.
Try to get them to say what's on their mind. from this point on your probing for information. You're trying to find out why they contacted you, but you want to get them to say it out loud.
 
Normally, they're going to trip over their words a little bit and go, "Uh, well, it's been a while since we spoke, and I wanted to see what you were up to," which is frustrating because they should just be direct about what they want.
 
What I always get my students to do is push them a little bit to reveal what's on their mind. Not too hard, of course. You also want them to work a little bit for it. You've literally just gone through one of the hardest times in your life, and they shouldn't just think that you will just automatically drop everything to see them. Make them work for a little bit. Make them come right out and say why they're contacting you.
This is why you need to always and consistently act like you are a prize. Act like there are twenty more people who are ready and willing to date you at a moment's notice. If that were the case, you wouldn't be so quick to answer your ex's text messages and be available. It would take some time, and he would investigate why they are contacting you. This will make you seem valuable.
 
This has a double whammy effect because you have given them their time, space, and freedom, and when they reach out to you, you're acting with high value. You're acting from a place of abundance and strength. They respect you even more now because you're not so quick to jump back into their arms.

What is it that you actually want?
 
It is so easy to lose focus when in the middle of a relationship that is going decently well. Yeah, there may be some, but you're not immediately ready to trade up just because those problems are there.
But this does lead me to suggest that you ask yourself on a constant basis if you are happy. Are you happy with this person? Were you happy with this person honestly, or were there times when you felt like breaking up with them?
 
Were there times when you were unhappy for a long stretch of time, like several weeks or months? Now, not every relationship is positive. There are going to be times when things are just not going well, like anything in life.
 
The reason this question comes up is because during so many of my coaching sessions, guys will say that there were so many times that they wanted to break up with their girlfriend. There were numerous occasions when they were unhappy, but they either never got around to fixing it or things simply improved during the relationship.
 
This goes along the same line as complacency because a lot of guys are not brave enough to leave a relationship that is decent in order to search for a relationship or a woman that is great. So many people date people who are not doing too well in life. Their lives are a complete mess; they have no focus, and they don't know what to do with their time or their energy.
 
It is during this time that many partners try to change the person they are with. They try to fix them, and they say to themselves that if only they fixed these issues, they'd be the perfect girlfriend.
High value men with high self esteem will not settle for just any woman. High-value men are on their way. which means the woman they are with has to be on the same page. It is because high value men are always improving themselves. High value men want a woman who does the same thing. high-value men, as well as one woman, who will support his mission and purpose.
 
Many men lack this mission and purpose, so they end up making their relationships and their women their purposes. That's why many men will date women who are full of red flags because they want to have some sort of project to work on. This is what happens when you make a relationship or woman your purpose.
 
A relationship and a woman are just a compliment to your life and something that you should just take or leave, not live your entire life for.
 
Many guys, during their breakup, will often forget what it is they’re even looking for. They stop focusing on what kind of woman they want in their lives. Again, this comes down to individual complacency.
This is critical because it is one of the primary reasons I see men failing today in general.
 
This was sort of mentioned earlier, but I want you to really go deep and ask yourself: Is your ex really somebody that you want back? If you do, that's fine; however, many of my clients tell me that they knew they could have done better but chose to stay with a woman who wasn't all that great.
This will help give you a little bit of closure if you're having a hard time seeing your ex for who they really were and trying to get past your emotions.
 
Healthy relationships
 
Healthy relationships operate with
•	respect,
•	dignity,
•	boundaries,
•	communication
•	compromise
I will often do calls with guys that are missing these key components. I was coaching a guy who had a girlfriend that got mad at him for being late for any kind of thing. He would be a little late at the grocery store, and she would get mad. He would get a haircut and be gone for a while, and she would get mad. His problem is that he didn’t set the right boundaries in the relationship. He just took the punishment.
 
Men with self esteem would never put up with this kind of behaviour. When I spoke to him, he realized how nice he was being and why that was leading the relationship down a bad path.
 
Women will always test you to see if you're a strong guy. Men who are leaders and who know their worth will always set proper boundaries and stand up to her if she's being disrespectful. At the end of the day, men just want peace in the household.
 
Men are the leaders of the relationship. When women test you, they are really seeing if you will stick to your masculine energy. They love to stir the pot, especially early in the relationship. Women who have dated quite a few guys will be testing more and more because they keep running into weak men.
 
It's common for some of my long-term students to run into these women. These women frequently turn off the guys I coach because they are so difficult to connect with in their feminine energy. It's too hard to get them to relax.
 
A healthy relationship is about having the right positive-to-negative ratio. In my experience, you want this ratio to be highly positive. Around 90 to 95 percent. Negative energy is loud and sticky. meaning we remember and feel it longer than positive energy.
 
This should always be your goal when getting into a relationship with someone. You should be looking for a high-quality woman who is looking to have a family and relax.
 
They are out there! It's hard to believe, but they are definitely out there. It may take you longer to find a woman like this, but you just have to keep looking. While doing this, you should be focused on your own energy and healing. When you do this, it's much easier to attract and keep high quality women.
 
ZERO TOLERANCE FOR NEGATIVE ENERGY
This concept changed my entire life. Like I said earlier, negative energy is loud and sticky, and you should get it away from you quickly.
 
Life is hard enough trying to make money to provide for yourself and your future. Its common for people to have a shitty boss who doesn't give a shit about you. Your home life should be peaceful and relaxed.
 
When i first tell men about this, they are almost shocked because they assume that things are supposed to be somewhat difficult. Dating the right woman can make or break you. If you're the type of guy who wants to do massive things with his life, you should just stay single until you make some progress with your goals. Dating will take time away from your work. When running a business, you need your emotions to be stable.
 
Always take more time to date the right woman. Do not ignore red flags when dating. It will always come back to bite you.
 
My life philosophy is "NO NEGATIVE ENERGY."
 
Now, negativity still comes into my life sometimes, but if I can control it, I get rid of it. People don't deserve your energy if you're trying to do better with your life.
 
I study the universal laws, and one of them is the law of attraction and the law of vibration. The law of vibration states that everything has a frequency. This is scientifically proven. You, me, the desk I'm sitting at, and the chair I'm in, all have a specific vibration. This cannot be changed.
 
Now the law of attraction is something you can influence and change. In basic terms, the law of attraction states that you attract what you are. If you're around negative people and negative energy, you will continue to attract that into your life.
 
To give an example from my own life. I used to blame everyone else but myself for my own problems. As soon as i stopped doing that and took complete ownership of my situation, everything changed for me.
 
Broke? your fault
Women don't like you? your fault
Fat and out of shape? your fault
 
That's the change I made. This works because it forces your mind to seek solutions for these problems. But if you're sitting around blaming everyone else for your problems, then nothing will change.
 
"Nothing happens unless you make it happen."
 
Blaming others is the easy way out. If you want to make progress in your life, blame yourself and then get to work.
 
The truth about the universe is that you can literally have anything you want. You can have the great relationship you seek. You want to be a millionaire? You can have that too. You want to be ripped? Yep, it's yours.
 
One law that people don't talk about is the law of cause and effect and the law of inspired action. YOU MUST TAKE ACTION TO GET RESULTS!
 
Let's say you want a million dollars per year. which is 83,333 a month. You need to serve people in this world in such a way that they are willing to give you money to solve their problems. Then you need to do it at scale.
 
Most people don't know this because they were simply never taught. Success is a learnable skill. You just need the right education.
 
I personally run a mastermind group on this. I made it expensive because i wanted committed and like minded people to join. The rest of my content is free to enjoy.
 
When I started learning how everything worked, my life changed for the better. You can do this too and apply the knowledge. It all depends on you.

Conclusion
Life is a bitch sometimes. Going through a breakup can make life feel so empty and pointless. I promise that if you just take it day by day, life has its rewards.
 
A rewarding life is not impossible to achieve. With the right focus, it can be done. I understand that most people reading this have a job and life obligations. It took me five years to get to where I am now at the time of writing this book. I was financially free after two years.
 
If you put away all distractions and focus for six months, you can change your entire life. It all begins with choice.
 
I used to think getting rich was something only certain people could have. It's not true. The same is true for a high-quality relationship.
 
People who get these are simply doing things differently than you. They aren't any better than you at all. just making different decisions.
 
Focus hard on where you want to go and who you want to become, and you can literally change your whole reality.
 
I was broke five years ago when I started. Now I never have to work another day in my life. I'm not saying this to brag. I'm no different or better than you. We have the same 24 hours.
 
When I became free, everything changed because I had no pressure. That immediately raised my vibration. which then made my relationship 20 times better. There is a system in place and you can escape that system if you so desire!
 
Thank you for reading, and I'll see you for the next book!
